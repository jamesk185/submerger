-It's time to go home, Colonel. - Come on, Colonel Harris!

He can't do that to me!
上校  该回家了 来吧  哈里斯上校！

581
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:31,790

00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:41,676
Papa?

583
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:45,649
Papa? Papa!

584
00:55:45,649 --> 00:55:47,450

"Sancte Antonius, ora pro nobis.

I don't know what happened upstairs this evening,
我不知道今晚楼上出了什么事

594
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:56,387
but from the way that the kitchen personnel reacted, it wasn't very pleasant.
但从厨房出入的人的脸色看来 准没啥好事

595
00:56:56,387 --> 00:57:02,884
I'm inclined to believe that my nephew bears a large part of the responsibility.
我想我侄儿得负大半责任…

596
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:09,359
Actually, I've taken a rather substantial risk in getting you this job.
事实上  我可是冒尽风险 才帮你找到这份差事

597
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,445
My reputation is at stake.
我的名声危在旦夕

598
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:16,116
And all this at a time when the letter you've been waiting for so long has finally arrived.
一切全为了这封你苦心等待的信 现在信终于来了

599
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:19,996
This means that your application for the examination has been accepted.

600
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:23,583
And is to be executed in nine or ten weeks.

As the test is comprehensive and the grading particularly severe,
试题范围包罗万象  评分相当严苛

602
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:33,592
I'd recommend you to, as soon as you've finished with these shoes,

Excuse me, Herr Kessler,

605
00:57:51,361 --> 00:57:55,950
but I found this pair of Crockett & Jones outside compartment nine.
我在九号车厢的门外找到这双鞋

606
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,827

607
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:00,079
Well, they are polished.
这双鞋我擦好了呀

608
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,234
I don't think so. Where is the chalk mark?
我可不这么认为

609
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:04,112
-Chalk mark? -Chalk mark!
那粉笔记号呢？

610
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:06,129
A chalk mark on the sole
粉笔记号？ 对  粉笔记号！

611
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:10,256
is the passenger's guarantee that the shoes have polished
在鞋底标上粉笔记号 是向旅客保证鞋子已经擦好了

612
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:12,633
and they've been polished by the conductor of the car!
而且还是由列车车长亲自擦的

613
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:15,763
I can't see how a chalk mark can be the passenger's guarantee.
我不懂粉笔记号 到底能对旅客保证什么

614
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:17,607
No, you've come here with your background
不对  不对  不对

615
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:22,060
in American culture, American way of thinking.
这全是你的美国文化背景在作祟 满脑子美国浆糊

616
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,021
But I ask you kindly, kindly, Herr Kessler,
但我善意地提醒你 凯斯勒先生

617
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:29,776
without humility you will no get anywhere.
不谦恭虚心点  你哪也走不通

618
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:32,488
Besides the guarantee, the chalk mark also indicates
除了向旅客保证外

619
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:34,999
the traveller's compartment. Take these shoes for example.
粉笔记号同时也标示 旅客的车厢号码

620
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:36,251
Where do they belong?
就拿这双鞋来说吧

621
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:40,634
- Now I've lost track of... - Ah, there you are.
这是几号车厢旅客的？ 我弄不清楚了

622
00:58:40,634 --> 00:58:42,957
And how will you find out?

623
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:46,059
Well, I could always ask one of the passengers.

624
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:53,009
When I return I want to see all the shoes marked with compartment numbers.

And under no circumstances will I tolerate any disturbance of the passengers.
无论如何 我都不准你打扰任何旅客

626

Do you have a moment? We need your help, conductor.

627
00:59:12,906 --> 00:59:16,729
I implore you, Herr Leopold, please, come along.

You are being led through the train.

But this sector is in a state of emergency

We therefore have to resort to this unworthy arrangement.

We'll proceed with our ceremony in secret,
