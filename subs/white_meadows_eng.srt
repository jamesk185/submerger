36
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,956
- It's coming.
- It's coming.

37
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,215
- Hi
-Aleykum hello

38
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,348
-I hope you're not too tired.
-I hope you too.

39
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,727
-You are late.
-There is no time.

40
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,105
- How long ago did it happen?
- About 8 days.

41
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,298
-Woman or man?
- Woman.

42
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:39,148
-Are you a relative?
-He has no relatives.

43
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,414
Just an old mother, but mourning
There are many people who keep it. She was so beautiful!

44
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,563
Waiting until you come and get it
We buried his body in salt.

45
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Poor girl died too young
and no one knows why.

46
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
All the women were jealous of him.

47
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,629
-Have you ever seen him?
- No.

48
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,258
His mother is waiting for you in pain.

49
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,970
This is it, please come in.

50
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,524
-Hi
-Aleykum hello.

51
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,770
It's good he died.

52
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,525
As he walked, his body would shake.

53
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,029
The heart of anyone who saw him would be shaken.

54
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,741
One day I was sitting right here...

55
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,119
When he looked at me as he passed...

56
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,581
My whole body felt a sweet shiver.

57
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,750
but he didn't stop.

58
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,420
He looked directly into my eyes.

59
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,131
I followed him.

60
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,138
Good thing he died. men its
He felt humiliated by.

61
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,560
It takes you to the water and more
It makes you very thirsty.

62
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,396
God save us.

63
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,483
If we had a grave
and if we buried him here,

64
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:47,781
Young people buried his grave at midnight
They would dig it up and take it out.

65
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,593
The men must go!
We want to remove his body.

66
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:07,944
A few men should remain to carry the body.
-We will stay. You can go.

67
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,212
<i>Hello.</i>

68
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,547
Who are you?

70
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,174
Nassim

72
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,052
You puppy! What are you doing here?

73
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,179
I can explain!

74
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:48,663
Do you want to take me back?

75
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,805
If you do, everyone will look at the dead woman
He will know that you want to look.

76
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,434
What will you do? No!
No! No!

77
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,269
Get off my boat!

78
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,520
Help... help!

79
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,902
My eyes are burning!

80
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,071
I can't swim!

81
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,077
help for god's sake
help me!

82
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,289
I don't know how to swim!

83
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:33,092
Tell everyone you want to see the naked woman
I will tell you. For God's sake, help me!

84
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,601
Then...

85
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,604
What were you doing on my boat?

86
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,609
I'm talking to you.

87
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,945
I will tell you.

88
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:41,911
Yesterday two men took them off the island if I obeyed them.
They said they would help me leave.

89
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,750
They took the body out and took it as their own.
They said they would bury him.

90
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,628
Nobody should notice.

91
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,173
I could find my father.
He's been away for a long time.

92
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:59,971
They said you go everywhere with your boat.
I can find him if you take me along.

93
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,648
Please take me with you.
I swear I will be your slave.

94
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,942
Nobody will know.

95
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,081
Alright.

96
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,001
I will take you with me...

97
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,669
on one condition

98
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,046
You will keep your mouth shut!

99
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,301
My job is heartache
It's about people who are.

100
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,306
If they find out you can hear,
They no longer open their hearts to me.

101
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,975
You must be deaf and dumb.

102
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,853
I will be both deaf and dumb.

103
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,356
As long as you take me with you
Say you will take it.

104
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,702
Get together.

105
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,798
Can I ask you something'?

106
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,056
Really people's tears
Can you turn it into a pearl?

107
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,356
With tears he cleanses the dead from their sins
They say it can purify.

108
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,322
Where are we going?

109
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,994
Straight ahead, son!

110
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,164
Mind you, not a word.
Remember, Deaf and dumb.

112
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,687
- Definitely
-Didn't I say you wouldn't say a word?

113
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:22,378
- Hi. Mr. Rahmat.
- Hi. What are you doing?

114
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,150
These poor things are too much
He died because of salt water.

115
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,430
The salt increases too much.

116
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,431
They go blind when they put their heads under water
It happens and they die of hunger.

117
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,980
Morad Bey's mother had a dream.
I'm researching it.

118
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,066
You are a good man. Let's go.

119
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,020
Hi!

120
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,815
- Hello!
-We were waiting for you.

123
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:36,122
-Salam aleykum
-Rahmat has arrived, mother!

124
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,258
He's not sane anymore.

125
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,395
I have come to end your tears.

126
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,403
I came to listen to your heartache.

127
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,280
Would you allow me?

128
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,538
The fairy has been in the well for 300 years.

129
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,542
Sea water has never been this salty.

130
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:28,048
Fairy to enter the well
When he came out of the sea in anger...

131
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,718
The sea wasn't even half as salty.

132
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:35,723
People did not commit many sins back then.

133
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:35,723
Tell them not to sin so much.

134
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,435
If they sin less,

135
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,854
It will turn into fresh, clean water.

136
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,733
And there will be no smoke from the fire.

137
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,652
The world will turn green.

138
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,072
Mr. Morad!

139
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,744
Mr. Morad, I found it! I found it!

140
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,662
Open the door for me.

141
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,878
After all, your dream is so wrong
It wasn't, Mom! - I found it!

142
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,548
bird cadavers
I was collecting and found this.

143
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,769
Next!

144
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,154
Much obliged

145
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,282
-Did you give your name?
- Yes.

146
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,992
Next !

147
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,747
Hello aleykum.

148
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,152
The child is deaf and blind.
Speak your mind.

149
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,405
- Thank you very much.
- Next.

150
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,534
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,431
- I found Khojasteh. He wants to see you.
- Tell him to come.

152
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,683
Get in!

153
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,855
- Hi.
- Hi.

154
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,859
Wishes are being collected.
You will deliver them.

155
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:42,362
As you wish.
I will be ready.

156
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,532
Next !

157
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,715
The jars are safe in the fairy's hands
must reach it somehow.

158
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,801
Go down as far as possible.

159
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,556
The further you go,
Wishes come so quickly.

160
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:03,235
Go quickly and carefully,
so the jars don't break.

161
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,530
They are entrusted to us, do you understand?

162
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,451
Climb quickly when I pull the rope.

163
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:16,498
If the sun rises and you're still there,
will be cancelled. Do you understand?

164
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,269
I can't walk properly.

165
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,772
What if I can't climb again?

166
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,235
And if I fail,

167
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:50,699
Khojasteh wishes to the fairy
Won't they say he couldn't deliver?

168
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,286
I just got married.

169
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,914
If I die, what will happen to the poor girl?

170
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:35,220
I'm too heavy. I can't even walk.
There are so many words in jars.

171
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,139
What are you saying?

172
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:40,045
You see everyone is waiting, go now.

173
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,144
However you like

174
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,940
Go!

175
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,054
Go! Go! Go!

176
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,943
Faster!

177
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,747
Go faster!

178
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,549
He must climb up!

179
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,094
- Come back!
- Come back! Come back!

180
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,054
Khojasteh!

181
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,581
Khojosteh, come up!

182
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,993
No thanks.

183
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,080
Take it.

184
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:44,104
After each ceremony, the container of tears
Clean carefully with clean water.

185
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:49,881
Otherwise, it will remain in the tear salts.

186
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,943
The container must be cleaned. So that the one who cries...

187
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,915
Every single tear of yours
He knows he is rewarded.

188
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:06,045
Otherwise, they are taken and
They can never cry again.

189
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,715
I think this job is difficult.

190
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,926
For 30 years people
I collected your tears.

191
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,013
But I enter that ceremony every time.

192
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,267
and suffering with someone and
I sit in tears...

193
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:22,613
And it feels like the first time

194
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,792
Tears should be treated with respect.

195
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,362
They are valuable. Single
One drop should not be wasted.

196
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,460
how difficult this job is
It will take a long time for you to realize it.

197
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,532
-What is your father's name?
- Cenobar.

198
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,762
Senobor?

199
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,226
What did he do?
- He was a shepherd.

200
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,395
It's weird that I don't know him

201
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,273
I know most of the people here.

202
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,360
What brought him to the sea?

203
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,196
I was so young, I don't remember.

204
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:18,284
They say: He led his flock to the pastures,
He spent too much time in the sun and his brain dried out.

205
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:19,870
Then one day that sea
of water and soil...

206
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:23,407
He wanted to go to places where it wasn't salty.

207
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,878
Where do you want to look for it?

208
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,506
Do you have an address?

209
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,552
No, I just know he's getting old.

210
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,285
Hi!

211
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,375
You always came alone.

212
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,920
I never imagined you with anyone else.

213
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,205
He's not a stranger. He is my son.
He is deaf and dumb.

214
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,583
May God heal him.

215
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,095
Any new news?

216
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,390
-Did it finally rain?
-Not yet.

217
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,351
This is such a small sky.

218
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,980
It brings dark clouds
but it's not raining.

219
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,192
If the sky carries grudges.
There's nothing you can do

220
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,030
If the sea does not mediate
The sky does not rain.

221
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,086
Hi.

222
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,340
Hi.

223
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:30,283
How are you?

224
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,756
Light the fire!

225
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,997
Prepare yourselves, witnesses!

226
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,018
Prepare the bed!

227
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,855
Don't be afraid!

228
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,858
You are going to a beautiful place.

229
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,319
This is destiny!

230
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,623
I don't want to be a bride!

231
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,043
Tell them I won't be a bride!

232
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,182
Don't let them take me, for God's sake!

233
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,087
What did you do with your tears, you whelp?

234
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,185
-I will pray for your health.
-I will pray for your happiness.

235
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:36,911
Help! I don't want to die!

236
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:38,900
I don't want to go to the sea.

237
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,107
I am scared.

238
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,276
God help me!

239
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:45,116
I don't want it!

240
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:42,103
This bride is pure and no one
I certify that you did not touch him.

241
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:46,190
He just loved the sea and now
She goes into his arms!

242
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,489
I confirm that this bride is a virgin!

243
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,451
He loved the sea and sent it to him!

244
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,376
The most beautiful young girl on the island
I confirm that it is.

245
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,338
and the people sacrificed him to the seas!

246
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,768
Blessed be! of happiness
can enjoy it.

247
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,359
The sea is a beautiful groom.

248
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:40,070
Blessed be your son-in-law.
to intercede with the sky...

249
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:41,370
Tell him to make it rain.
Thus you will be Blessed.

250
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:47,043
Don't worry, your daughter will be happy.

251
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,131
My sweet girl!

252
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:01,348
For a visit, I will have to go to the sea.

253
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,819
- What happened?
- I saw him.

254
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,324
He went after her.
He was far away when I saw him.

255
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,494
Are you sure you are Rahmat's son?

256
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,580
Yes, he was a deaf, dull child.

257
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,500
I sent two people after him.

258
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,361
Until I think of something
Don't say a word until.

259
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,771
Don't hit me, don't beat me!

260
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,358
For God's sake, don't shoot!

261
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:57,983
Don't hit him!

262
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,443
Don't hit!

263
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,697
Stop, your tongue is loosened. It's a miracle!

264
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:08,327
God forgave him, so should you!

265
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,653
I'm on fire

266
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,156
I'm on fire

267
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,332
I'm on fire.

268
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,669
I'm on fire. My wounds are burning.

269
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,427
Salt water will keep your wounds clean.

270
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,721
Sleep.

271
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,766
I'm on fire.

272
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,189
I'm thirsty

273
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,691
This.

274
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,819
You can't drink water, you die.

275
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:27,781
I'm thirsty.

276
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:28,407
I'm thirsty.

277
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,746
This.

My wounds are burning.

280
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:39,386
My wounds are burning.

281
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,506
This.

282
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,843
Get up.

What did you do with your tears?
Don't you want to tell?

00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:06,195
My eyes are burning.

285
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,075

Stand up son, we are here.

I will be back soon.

We are here today as always...

No one knows what will happen next.

00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,804
Every day is new, more joyful
We see a face.

297
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,433
If you can hear me, a man with a thousand faces,

With what face do you see people today?

How will you make us happy? Eh?

300
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,070
He wants to say something.

301
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,699
Okay, he says: if someone is miserable...

302
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:04,581
Feel the pain of that young man

Congratulations.

313
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,038
We have a wedding today.

314
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,499
The bride should sit here.

316
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:53,797

00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:01,596
Yes?.. The first time no one
I know you didn't say "yes".

320
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,640
Second time: "yes"?

321
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,394
No? Then why did you wear a wedding dress?
Look, once again...

322
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:11,315
You either say "yes" or it
You don't deserve to wear the dress.

323
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:15,736
But what about the groom?
Don't stay away from happiness.

324
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:19,531
Listen to your elders.
Will you say "yes"?

325
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,951
Won't you say "yes"? Under any circumstances?

326
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:27,497
He won't say "yes". wedding canceled
It was done, there is no beauty by force.

327
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,045
But come on, we worked hard for this.

328
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,715
We invited many guests,
We prepared meals...

329
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:41,011
We spent a lot of money. Everyone to you
He came to pay his respects.

330
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,015
Think a little more, don't ruin your life,

331
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,851
The groom is a sweet-natured monkey.

332
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,227
and rich!

333
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:54,608
You should see the paintings he made.
He painted the sea red.

334
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,480
The old man said to him: "The sea
"Dye it blue, not red."

335
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:02,949
"No, the sea is always blue
"Who said it was?" he said.

336
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,993
The old man was very angry.

337
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:09,748
He didn't forbid him to paint, he just
He asked him to paint it correctly.

338
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,600
Are you ok'?

339
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,565
How are your eyes? Can you see?

341
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,278
- Yes.
-What do you see? Don't talk nonsense.

342
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:44,449
His eyes are bad. He sees distortedly,
That's why he speaks garbled.

343
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,451
He is not even aware of himself.

344
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,787
My eyes are your mercy
He can see that it is.

345
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,249
I'm thirsty, water.

346
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:27,275
Rahmat, my nose itches.

347
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,292
Is it good?

348
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,421
His vision is distorted, but he doesn't know what it is.

349
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,803
- Is it ready to be washed?
- Let's get it.

350
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,391
Again.

351
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,938
Wash your head well.

352
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,568
Wash his head too.

353
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,279
pour some on

354
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,365
Wash your ears.

355
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,370
Hold it.

356
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,476
What should I do?

357
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,728
Go up, up!

358
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,649
Go up!

359
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,649
Go up!

360
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,371
Look at the sun!

361
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,670
Climb and look at the sun!

362
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,838
Look at the sun!

363
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,926
-My eyes are burning!
-I said look at the sun!

364
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:14,766
- I'm going blind.
-Look at the sun, your eyesight will come back!

365
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,061
Climb up or I'll come and take you out!

366
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,694
Look at the sun!

367
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,865
Climb up!

368
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,326
My eyes are popping out!

369
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,621
Look at the sun!

370
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,421
Look at the sun and your eyesight will come back!

371
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,934
Open your eyes.

372
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,739
What color is the sea?

373
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,582
I can still see it.

374
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,792
I can still see!
