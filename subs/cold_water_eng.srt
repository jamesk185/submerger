00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,343
COLD WATER

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,220
<i>They burned the harvest.</i>

4
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,590
They killed all the animals.

5
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,037
The German army continued retreating.

6
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,076
We heard no more guns
on the road to Budapest.

7
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,408
Everything was quiet for two days.

8
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,912
Complete silence.

9
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,848
Then we heard
that the Russians were coming.

10
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,454
Everyone panicked.

11
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,562
Really panicked.

12
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,557
Why did they panic?

13
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,356
Why?

14
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,933
The Russian army

15
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:52,610
was full of youngsters
from the Caucasus and Mongolia.

16
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,244
They were savages.

17
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,782
Real savages!

18
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,788
I don't know how to explain it.

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,010
My father packed
our most precious belongings

20
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,645
in crates.

21
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,250
He walled some of them up
in the cellar,

22
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,684
and my uncles buried the rest

23
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,857
in the woods.

24
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,921
Isn't that your father's car?

25
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,795
Give it to me.

26
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,970
It was there yesterday!

27
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,270
So what'?

28
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,009
Stop it! You'll bend the antenna.

29
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,881
You're a pain in the <i>ass!</i>

30
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,352
Listen.

31
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,018
Not bad.

32
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,694
We can do better.

33
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,403
Shit.

34
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,300
There.

35
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,404
Not so loud!

36
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,706
That's great.

37
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,057
She could at least talk to my father.

38
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,531
It's not that hard, damn it!

39
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,904
Why bother? Your dad wants custody.
The courts gave it to him.

40
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,739
What if I don't want to go back
to that moron!

41
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,006
He can't make you.
It's your choice, not your mother's.

42
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,348
He'll get me back if he wants.

43
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,016
When?

44
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:19,081
Actually, he wants to put me in a home.
The Beausoleil clinic.

45
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,196
He thinks I need care like Mom.
- You never told me.

46
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,421
- I don't tell you everything.
- I tell you everything.

47
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,626
- Why are you smiling'?
- No reason.

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,032
- Next time tell me why.
- Give me a break!

49
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,638
Last year he tore down all my posters,

50
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,440
so I slashed his tires
with a screwdriver.

51
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,207
He chased me down the street,
dragged me back,

52
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,446
and started kicking me,

53
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,721
so I bit his ankle
till my mouth was full of blood!

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,959
Is that why he sent you
to Beausoleil?

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,825
I went there...

56
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,460
but they wouldn't let me see you.

57
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:08,732
Later you told me the same shit
you told everyone else.

58
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,111
I'm scared, Gilles.

59
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,247
I'm really scared.

60
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,483
I know.

61
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,817
I don't want to go back.
Promise you'll help me.

62
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
Yeah.

63
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,489
Don't say it like that.
This is serious.

64
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,468
- I know.
- No, you don't know.

65
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,438
You're still just a kid, but that's okay.

66
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,443
Is that why you were smiling?

67
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,144
It's true. I have my books, my records,
my papers, and no experience.

68
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:04,225
- Can't your mother help?
- Get real! She's useless.

69
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,164
The younger guy she lives with
works in a betting agency.

70
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,632
They'd really impress a court!

71
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,729
And he's an Arab,
and they're both Scientologists!

72
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,975
No courFs ever going
to give her custody.

73
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,549
What will you do?

74
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,910
Nothing.

75
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,881
The court judgment is final.

76
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,990
We'll see.

77
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,559
See what'?

78
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,227
I can't tell you yet. It's a secret.

79
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,162
I'll tell you anyway.

80
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,865
I'll tell only you. I swear.

81
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,445
Let me go, assholes!

82
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,448
Jesus! Grab her!

83
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,087
<i>“My overheated blood

90
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,788

00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,350
and hidden corners

105
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,080
to expose myself to women from afar

106
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,986
in the condition in which I'd have liked
to be in their company.

107
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,886
What they saw wasn't
the obscene object.

108
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,393
I never even thought of that.

109
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,869
It was the ridiculous object.”

110
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,238
Mr. Guersaint, continue reading.

111
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,709
You're not following along.

112
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,710
Fine. Then I'll help you.

113
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,742
We're at “the ridiculous object.”

114
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,218
Stan reading from

116
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,389
What's this?

117
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,693
<i>Wheres The Confessions?</i>

118
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,566
I forgot it at home.

119
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,071
Very well.

120
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,610
Since you can't read for us,

121
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,941
you can tell us what you remember.

122
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,938
What happens next?

123
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,060
If you'd read it, you'd remember.

124
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,465
Do you even know
what we're talking about?

125
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,762
What's this “ridiculous object"?

126
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,580
It should interest you.

127
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,483
It's his... or his...

128
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,747
What do you think, Gilles?

129
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,826
I'm sick of wasting my time
on assholes like you!

130
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,694
You piss me off!

131
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,360
Get out!

132
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,268
Go on!

133
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,172
Take your things...

134
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,779
since you're so interested
in literature...

135
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,949
and tell the assistant principal
I don't want you back!

136
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,686
Go on! Get out!

137
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,296
Asshole!

138
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,236
Those pricks broke my bracelet
and took my wallet!

139
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,709
Your wallefs right here.

140
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,687
Nothing's missing?

141
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,585
You can check later.

142
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,081
They had no right to keep me!

143
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,972
Where did they keep you'?

144
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,574
In some shitty locker room.

145
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,721
What happened there?

146
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,919
Is that all?

147
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,097
They tried to intimidate me,
but no such luck.

148
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,127
You've done this before.

149
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,300
- Maybe.
- You know you have.

150
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,408
There's no proof!
I never signed anything. Prove it!

151
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,305
We have their word.

152
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,815
And their word also says
they saw you today

153
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,784
stealing records in the store
with your boyfriend.

154
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,821
Their word's not worth shit.

155
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,924
Why?

156
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,526
They're not sworn officers.
That's why.

157
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,324
Besides, I have a few things
I could tell too.

158
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,626
Meaning?

159
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,638
Nothing.

160
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,307
You're not at school.

161
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,042
This is a police station.
Answer my questions.

162
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,872
Nothing. Ask them
what happened in the locker room.

163
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,357
It was the tall guy
with the crew cut.

164
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,292
He and I were alone in there.

165
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,531
He tried to ask me
a few dumb questions.

166
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,035
When he saw I wasn't answering...

167
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,531
he started feeling under my skirt.

168
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,476
And then?

169
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,217
He took off my panties and then...

170
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,053
he stuck his finger in me.
I was dry.

171
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,556
And you let him?

172
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,021
I felt nothing. He didn't exist.

173
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,658
Did this go on long?

174
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,326
No idea.

175
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,904
Then he made me kneel down,
and he took out his cock.

176
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,678
<i>Did he ask you to...</i>

177
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,712
- He didn't ask.
- He forced you?

178
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,407
No, he just pissed on me.

179
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,920
It's true.
He pissed on me with his cock.

180
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,236
That's a serious allegation.

181
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,602
Super serious!

182
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,763
Now, then...

183
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,660
Christine Huan...

184
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,728
I've had your file here
for three weeks.

185
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,000
Know what's in it?

186
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,977
A court order that your father
wants enforced immediately.

187
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,812
In other words...

188
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,846
they want me to send two officers...

189
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,815
to take you to his house...

190
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,519
with or without your consent.

191
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,457
Anything to say?

192
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,124
No.

193
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,765
When your parents divorced,

194
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,602
did you ask to live with your mother?

195
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,339
No one asked me.

196
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,341
You prefer your father?

197
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,511
I'd rather die
than live with that worm!

198
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,510
And now'?

199
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,185
I'm just waiting
till I'm old enough to take off.

200
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,364
And go where?

201
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,862
I know where.

202
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,031
You won't say?

203
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,689
Your mother won't answer my letters.

204
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,722
She's not stupid!
She knows what you want!

205
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,390
It's too late now.

206
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,198
I might have been able to help...

207
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,601
but it's too late now.

208
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,167
Your fathefs here for you.

209
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,846
I didn't have time
to make Chapon's delivery.

210
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,816
That took an hour of my time.

211
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,756
Listen...

212
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,692
take the van.

213
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,190
There's a roll of fencing...

214
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,299
and 250 posts.

215
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:31,097
Count them with the customer,
or he'll try something again.

216
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,308
You could have shaved.

217
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,548
Listen, unload the van for him.

218
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,183
No, don't. He got 10% off.

219
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,982
For that he doesn't get labor.

220
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,920
STAFF ONLY

221
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,529
It's from my dad's work site.

222
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,634
One of his buddies got it for me.

223
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,840
...six, seven, eight.

224
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,617
It's okay to handle it.

225
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,677
It only works with the detonators.

226
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,719
These are them.

227
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,949
You stick the fuse in on this side.

228
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,390
The stick goes on the other side.

229
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,161
This is Bickford fuse.

230
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,701
Thirteen feet to cut up as you like.
It's string and gunpowder.

231
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,710
But remember:
Once it's lit, you can't put it out.

232
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,042
Who said
you could just walk in here?

233
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,549
Whose place is this?

234
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,549
- Is Madeleine here?
- Answer me!

235
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,620
Whose place is this?

236
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,448
Show some fucking respect!

237
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,253
See you, Mourad.

238
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,599
They took Christine away from her.
Did you know that?

239
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,139
- No.
- The security guards got her.

240
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,798
I know that.

241
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,635
You don't give a fuck
what happens to her

242
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,771
when you steal your goddamn LPs!

243
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,442
Mommy and Daddy can always
get you out of trouble

244
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,452
or cough up some dough
like last time!

245
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,818
You're drunk! I'm not listening!

246
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,394
Give me the key
and go sleep it off!

247
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,723
Give me the fucking key!

248
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,460
I said I'd smash your face in
if you did it again!

249
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,664
This isn't a game for Christine.
It's her life.

250
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,472
Okay, Mourad, cut it out.

251
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,642
Hands off, fag!

252
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,138
They told you last time
they'd call in the cops.

253
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,410
The cops gave her to her dad,

254
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,815
and he's sending her to Beausoleil.

255
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,828
What now?

256
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,806
She was gone
when Madeleine got to the station,

257
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,474
so she went to the hardware store.

258
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,842
The <i>sales</i> guy threw her out.

259
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,174
Were you there?

260
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,378
No, she called from a phone booth.

261
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,312
She was bawling.
Her dress was all torn.

262
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,615
She wanted me to go get her.

263
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,721
I'm late for the betting agency
<i>as</i> it is.

264
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,040
Your room's ready.

265
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,417
Here.

266
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,157
Take this before bed.
<i>It'll</i> do you good.

267
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,787
It's not strong at all.

268
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:08,764
You don't have to take them,
but I'll have to tell Dr. Varennes.

269
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,080
That's better.

270
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:29,382
If you need anything,
my office is down the hall.

271
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:33,024
There's a buzzer there to call me.

272
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,251
Good night.

273
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,356
Come look at this.

274
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,763
Remember the Death <i>aflhe Virgin</i>
I showed you at the Louvre?

275
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,868
This figure at the Virgin's feet -
remember him?

276
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:32,815
One hand over his eyes,
the other at his throat, his head down.

277
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,722
I find few images of suffering
more moving than this.

278
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,824
What about you'?

279
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,262
Does it affect you the same way...

280
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,288
or not'?

281
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,835
When the painting was finished,

282
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,641
Caravaggio was accused of using
a drowned prostitute as his model.

283
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,485
If you look closely,
it seems plausible.

284
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,150
It caused quite a scandal,

285
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,654
and Caravaggids patrons
refused to accept the painting.

286
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,293
He couldn't defend himself,

287
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:19,830
because he had to flee Rome
for killing a man in a duel.

288
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,326
Are you listening?

289
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:23,968
Yeah.

290
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,829
Did you see the letter
I got from your school?

291
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,141
No.

292
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,333
Come on, I'm not stupid.

293
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,343
It was on the table.

294
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,513
I know you go through my papers.

295
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,815
Yeah, I saw it.

296
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,383
Good.

297
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,822
And what do you think about it?

298
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,787
What should I think?
They can expel me next year.

299
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,864
I'll pass the exam anyway.

300
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,031
- What if you fail?
- I won't.

301
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,133
What if you fail'?

302
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,531
I'll fucking pass!

303
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,362
Please don't raise your voice to me.

304
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:04,167
I've had enough of these hassles.

305
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:08,472
You were disciplined twice last year,
for God's sake!

306
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,009
Mess around,
but don't let them catch you.

307
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,345
I'm sick of seeing the principal

308
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,318
and bowing and scraping to her.

309
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,815
Two years ago...

310
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,994
we transferred you to humanities
because math was too hard.

311
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,393
Then a schedule with no Latin,

312
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,558
because that was even easier.

313
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,228
So what is it you want'? Tell me.

314
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:38,568
Some private school
full of idiots and daddy's boys?

315
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,111
Just like your moronic cousin

316
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,376
who's still in high school
at ZO-something?

317
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,611
Stop bringing up that idiot!

318
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,583
I'm 16 and I haven't failed
my exam yet, okay?

319
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,458
If you don't want to answer them
or see them, don't.

320
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,890
It's my problem!

321
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,756
Don't use that tone of voice.

322
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,456
And if you don't mind,
ifs my problem too.

323
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,295
I do mind!

324
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,706
That bitch
has been after me all year!

325
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,602
Poor little martyr.

326
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:17,249
Any graffiti, theft, or walkouts,
and she immediately sends for me!

327
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,811
It's not always me.
I'm sick of being a scapegoat.

328
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,221
Now she's writing to you.

329
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,621
What have I done now?
I've had enough!

330
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,252
If she wrote to me,
she had her reasons.

331
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,559
I'm telling you there's no reason!

332
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,497
It's an obsession with her!
She's out to get me!

333
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:43,236
When you get like this,
there's no talking to you.

334
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,833
You don't even try to understand!

335
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,570
Stop it, Gilles!

336
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,584
<i>Little jerk...</i>

337
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,559
Can I talk to you now?

338
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,369
It 13 my problem too.

339
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,171
I just spoke to your mother.

340
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,010
She received a copy of the letter.

341
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,647
What did she say?

342
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,054
She wants you
in a boarding school.

343
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,558
She spoke to the principal,
who thinks it's a great idea.

344
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,853
A brilliant idea.

345
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,899
What can I say?

346
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,996
Your grades are bad...

347
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,171
you're constantly in trouble...

348
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:28,008
you fly off the handle
at the slightest remark.

349
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,408
Like a moment ago.

350
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,911
I'm never home.
I can't watch you all the time.

351
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,541
You have to be able
to look after yourself.

352
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,278
I know, and I keep trying.

353
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,079
You'd never guess it.

354
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,053
Some kids your age
already have jobs.

355
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,620
You're lucky
you've never lacked money.

356
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:22,158
It's no fun at your age
being left to your own devices,

357
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,394
but that's how it is.

358
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,337
That's life,
and you have to act like an adult.

359
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,140
That's what you need to learn.

360
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,002
I really don't know

361
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,246
what to tell your mother these days.

362
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,676
I can't make any commitments

363
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,252
regarding your work
or mental balance.

364
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,656
She said she'd handle everything.

365
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,491
She knows a very decent place
in the southwest somewhere.

366
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,631
She said it's for your own good,
and I didn't say no.

367
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,495
I said okay.

368
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,844
Gilles.

369
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,213
Come here.

370
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,895
Come here.

371
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,605
Look how this works.

372
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,765
- I'm doing my homework.
- Do it later.

373
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,777
Show me later.
I can't concentrate.

374
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,973
You're just copying!

375
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,214
It has to be neat.
You're a pain in the <i>ass.</i>

376
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,285
I can't show you later.

377
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,597
You get all that?

378
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,834
You show Maxime.

379
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:58,711
Can't you? He's coming tomorrow
after his riding lesson.

380
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,784
- Forget it.
- Why?

381
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,318
I'm not interested. That's kids' shit.

382
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,186
Tell him he doesn't owe me
anything, okay?

383
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,661
Turn the light off.

384
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,492
<i>I will“.</i>

385
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,017
Give me the scissors now.

386
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:55,358
You'll do something dumb.

387
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,688
Give them to me.

388
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,501
This isn't funny.

389
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,974
You're out of your mind!

390
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,440
- She's nuts!
- Look what you did.

391
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,879
Take the scissors away
from that bitch!

392
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,623
Come on!

393
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,021
Let go of me!

394
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,528
Come on!

395
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,542
You'll break her arm!

396
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,569
Are you crazy! Back off!

397
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,306
Okay, okay.

398
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,713
It's all right. It's all over.

399
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,113
I was afraid you weren't coming.

400
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,555
Thanks for worrying about me.

401
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,288
It's not that.
I'm talking about Christine.

402
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,131
- What about her?
- She's here.

403
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,068
- What's she doing here?
- She ran away.

404
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,470
- How?
- I don't know.

405
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,266
She must have said something.

406
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,842
No, she just turned up at dinner,
really out of it.

407
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,071
- Were your folks there'?
- Of course.

408
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,781
What did you tell them?

409
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,439
A load of shit.

410
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,449
- Did they believe it?
- Not a word.

411
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,576
- They'll call her dad!
- No way.

412
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:37,585
Says who?

413
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,588
They're not snitches.

414
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,587
Yeah, sure.

415
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,996
They must have talked to her!

416
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:56,630
No, I gave her coffee in my room
and brought her here.

417
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,606
- You should have let her sleep.
- At home?

418
00:52:58,709 --> 00:52:59,505
Of course.

419
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,835
- She can't stay there.
- You have room.

420
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,539
What about my folks'?

421
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,174
Tell them her mom went away.

422
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,684
- Yeah, they'll buy that!
- Make something up.

423
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,345
No, you take her!

424
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,684
- I can't!
- Well, same here!

425
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,019
So let her go back to the clinic?

426
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,818
No, to her mother's.

427
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,692
No, her father will go straight there.

428
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,129
- She might have an idea.
- The cops will come and she'll panic.

429
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,998
Why the cops?

430
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,298
Her father will send them!

431
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,064
We can't let her down.

432
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,199
You're crazy! You've seen her.
She needs care.

433
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,376
She's been okay all year.

434
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,880
Now look at her,
after one day at the clinic.

435
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,019
They just gave her a sedative.
It's normal.

436
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,917
And electroshock treatment
is normal too!

437
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,887
Now you're just ranting.

438
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,888
They use it at the clinic.
My mom works there!

439
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,894
- You just want to be rid of her.
- You don't care.

440
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,700
Where's Christine?

441
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,742
I don't know. At the clinic.

442
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,916
- They said she ran away.
- I'm sure he knows.

443
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,585
- I know what?
- Don't fuck with me!

444
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,550
They thought she'd come home.

445
01:05:57,654 --> 01:05:59,816
Good thing she's smarter than that.

446
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,083
Mourad remembered about this party.

447
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,987
We haven't seen her.

448
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,960
She must have taken a train to Paris.

449
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,760
Right! You think I'm an idiot?
Out of my way!

450
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,490
You and Mourad argued earlier?

451
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,961
Yeah, but it's okay.
I understand.

452
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:20,730
No, he's a pain with everyone!
He's really losing it!

453
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,637
While he was still on the soccer team,
things were okay.

454
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:29,474
But ever since he started
at the betting agency, it's been crazy.

455
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:50,159
What has Christine told you?

456
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,059
About what'?

457
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,536
I don't know.
About me, her father...

458
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:02,068
She must tell you something.
She won't say a word to me.

459
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:08,347
I can see she's unhappy,
but I don't know how to help.

460
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:14,520
Does she want to live with her dad?
- No way!

461
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:17,252
- What, then?
- To be alone maybe.

462
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,920
She's only 16!
I can't let her go running off!

463
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:23,590
I don't know!
You asked what she's told me!

464
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,427
She wants to be alone.

465
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,764
But you agree it's crazy, right?

466
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,430
Maybe it's her way
of telling you something.

467
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,269
Like?

468
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,377
Like pay more attention to her.

469
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:39,909
Yeah, I know.
She wishes my life were more stable.

470
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,312
Maybe.

471
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,283
A good job, and without Mourad.

472
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,453
- I don't think -
- Mothers and daughters are like that!

473
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:50,560
She judges me!
Well, I'm not giving up my life for her!

474
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,788
Just like with her father.
Has to be the center of attraction.

475
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,401
At the store he was
a self-centered control freak!

476
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:03,735
That's why I left.
I won't let her pull the same act!

477
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,269
I'll live the way I want.

478
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:10,311
So I'm a Scientologist -
that's my business!

479
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,643
She's not here.
We'll try your sister's and the station,

480
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,615
then back here in case she turns up.

481
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,461
Sorry I got all worked up.
She means a lot to me.

482
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,667
I don't want to lose her.

483
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,342
You swear you don't know?

484
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:46,378
You haven't seen her'?

485
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,041
I swear.

486
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,752
- We have to go.
- One question first.

487
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,218
What?

488
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,722
Wait.

489
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,828
It's a secret.

490
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:34,522
It's no time for dumb secrets!

491
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,723
It's not dumb. Promise not to tell'?

492
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,060
I promise.

493
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:40,598
Come on.

494
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,056
You remember Chloe'?

495
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,256
You know, in fourth year.

496
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,292
I wasn't in your class.

497
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:11,924
I was always with her,
a blonde girl.

498
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:14,934
Oh, yeah.
She vanished a long time ago.

499
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:17,768
That's just it. She didn't vanish.

500
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,539
Her dads a painter.

501
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,746
They moved to an old farm
in the Lozére region.

502
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,652
The farm's full of artists.

503
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,755
They redid the place. It's great.

504
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,324
How do you know? It might suck.

505
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,223
She writes a lot.
She's my best friend.

506
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,960
You want to go there?

507
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,225
I've wanted to for a long time.

508
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,228
I've never told anyone.

509
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,264
Except you.

510
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,967
I want you to come.

511
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,276
- When?
- Right now.

512
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,675
I don't have a thing on me!

513
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,782
Neither do I.

514
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:11,654
Wait.

515
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,193
What?

516
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,261
You hesitated.
You shouldn't have.

517
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,763
I'll go alone.

518
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,799
Just give me a second.

519
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:23,599
No, not one second.
It's too late.

520
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:33,847
I'll come.

521
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:44,016
We'll be all alone, you know?

522
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,556
No family...

523
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,358
no money, no home.

524
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:55,532
You'll have me...

525
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:59,703
and I'll have you. That's all.

526
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,307
I know.

527
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:06,848
Still want to come'?

528
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:09,481
Yes.

529
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:30,576
- I thought they'd never leave.
- Think they'll be back?

530
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:34,477
No, they think you're in Paris,
that you'll turn up tomorrow.

531
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,651
They can go screw themselves.

532
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,184
Take Frangoisds sweater.
It's warm.

533
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,954
You'll need it.

534
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:50,190
And my jacket.

535
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:52,297
No, I'll be okay.

536
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,165
I want you to have it with you.

537
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,853
Here.

538
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:14,820
It's not much, but maybe it'll help.

539
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,149
Take it.

540
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:45,385
Has Chloe' got a phone number?

541
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,318
No, there's no phone.

542
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,719
Or water or electricity either.

543
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:53,418
How about an address?

544
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,762
I thought you two wrote to each other.

545
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,738
We've never written.

546
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,920
Gilles doesn't know.
I don't want him to.

547
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,915
I don't want to go alone.

548
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,261
You do love him'?

549
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,389
Yes, I love him.

550
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,259
I love only him.

551
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,006
Stop looking at the map.

552
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,888
I told you ifs on the Villefort road.

553
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,552
Call them.
Maybe they could come get us.

554
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:26,026
There's no phone or water or electricity.

555
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,219
How do they wash up?

556
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,554
There's a well.

557
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:36,997
And?

558
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:40,735
You use a basin.
You heat the water.

559
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,707
It's simple enough.

560
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:44,843
Have you ever done it?

561
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,545
No.

562
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,078
Gimme a light?

563
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:53,181
Did Chloé tell you all that?

564
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:54,920
Yes.

565
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,152
We won't be there by dark.

566
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,901
It doesn't look that far on the map.

567
01:25:45,107 --> 01:25:48,338
It's a winding road, at least 12 miles.

568
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:51,780
Twelve miles...

569
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:55,148
That's nothing.

570
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:23,104
There are no cars on the road.

571
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:38,149
And it'll be dark soon.
