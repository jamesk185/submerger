1
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,376
You will now listen to my voice.

2
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:57,343
My voice will help you and guide
you still deeper into Europa.

3
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,001
Every time you hear my voice,

4
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:04,181
with every word and every number,

5
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:10,886
you will enter a still deeper layer,
open, relax ed and receptive.

6
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,609
I shall now count from one to ten.

7
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:22,282
On the count of ten,
you will be in Europa.

8
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:26,283
I say one.

9
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:31,747
And as you focus your attention
entirely on my voice,

10
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:35,750
you will slowly begin to relax.

11
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:38,334
Two.

12
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:44,256
Your hands and your fingers are
getting warmer and heavier.

13
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:46,551
Three.

14
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:50,515
The warmth is spreading through
your arms

15
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,517
to your shoulders
and your neck.

16
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,143
Four.

17
00:01:56,907 --> 00:02:00,277
Your feet and your legs get heavier.

18
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,277
Five.

19
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:07,033
The warmth is spreading
to the whole of your body.

20
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,041
On six I want you to go deeper.

21
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,296
I say six.

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,881
And the whole of your relax ed
body is slowly beginning to sink.

23
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:25,517
Seven.

24
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:31,475
You go deeper and deeper and
deeper.

25
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:33,689
Eight.

26
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,826
On every breath you take you go
deeper.

27
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,704
Nine.

28
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,373
You are floating.

29
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,208
On the mental count of ten you
will be in Europa.

30
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,719
Be there at ten.

31
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,016
I say ten.

32
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:09,067
You are listening to the noise of rain

33
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,820
beating against a large metal drum.

34
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:14,943
Go closer.

35
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:36,340
There's a fence and you have
to stop.

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,887
You are walking across the railyard,

37
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,565
and you've been travelling by train
from Bremerhaven,

38
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:51,436
and before that on a ship from
New York.

39
00:03:55,911 --> 00:04:01,782
You are in Germany.
The year is 1945.

40
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,817
His name is Leopold Kessler.

41
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,954
I'm your uncle.
You may embrace me.

42
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:55,171
I have received this letter from
your father.

43
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,474
He has the nerve to ask me
to find you a job.

44
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,435
My God!

45
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:03,190
Isn't he aware of the situation in
Germany?

46
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,233
My father...

47
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,569
I do not wish to know anything
about my brother.

48
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,317
He left our country at a difficult time,
for that I'll never forgive him.

49
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,701
Family bonds are intolerable!

50
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:16,619
Well, also I'll probably regret my
kindness dearly...

51
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:21,496
Due to my position I succeeded
to get you a job in Zentropa.

52
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,960
Your reasons to apply for this job,

53
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,965
and why you are here at all,
is of no interest to me.

54
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:30,085
-Uncle, I truly...
-No, I don't want any gratitude.

55
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:43,358
Zentropa will give no guarantee

56
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,896
that only new material will be used
for your uniform.

57
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,901
Your uniform will be delivered
within twelve hours.

58
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,000
Remember that the uniform has
to be changed twice a year.

59
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:06,714
The uniform is the property
of the company,

60
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:09,087
but paid by the employee.

61
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,257
Give me your wallet, please.

62
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:13,668
Thanks.

63
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,523
Is your nephew ready to be examined,
Herr Kessler?

64
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:22,850
Thank you, doctor.

65
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,417
Thank you, Herr Kessler.

66
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,169
There's no need for further
examination.

67
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,626
Your nephew is of standard health.

68
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:48,258
Standard fee, please.

69
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,505
Your wallet.

70
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,231
The German citizens you'll meet,

71
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,815
will all give you the impression
of friendliness,

72
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,233
but never for a moment believe

73
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:06,817
that it's anything but trying to gain
something from you.

74
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:09,856
All Germans will hate you,

75
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:12,904
and in my opinion,
they are right in doing so.

76
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,286
We're all living at the mercy of the
Americans.

77
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,368
The military authorities have tied
Zentropa hand and foot.

78
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:26,872
Your fellow countrymen treat
Europeans without much respect.

79
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:30,763
Humility, Kessler.

80
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:33,008
Never forget humility.

81
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,410
Don't draw the curtains!

82
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,710
What are you doing?
Do you want to wake the sleeping?

83
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,338
All these people work at night
and need their sleep.

84
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:06,125
-I just wanted to look at...
-There's nothing to see!

85
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:11,843
You are in Germany
just after the war.

86
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,428
You are cold.

87
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:20,146
You're covering yourself up with the
clothes you have in your suitcase.

88
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:28,072
You are to start your training as a
sleeping car conductor.

89
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:34,740
When you have rested you will be
on your way to your new job.

90
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,038
Get up.

91
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,914
Get up and be on your way.

92
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,757
Come on, come on!

93
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,727
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

94
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:59,189
-Tonight you'll be going on train 317.
-Frankfurt-Berlin.

95
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:02,526
-Tomorrow, train 212.
-Berlin-Munich.

96
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,989
And then on 522.

97
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,699
Then we return here.
Now we shall receive our papers.

98
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,698
Timetable, list of sales, receipts,
electrical chart, green checkbook,

99
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,665
book of tickets, account book,
and the green journal.

100
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,576
Thank you, Fr�ulein Schulze.

101
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:21,913
The inspector wants you at
turntable 3.

102
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:23,469
Really?

103
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:25,841
I have promised not to say anymore,

104
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:29,517
but I think he's got a surprise for you.

105
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,344
Thank you. Come on!

106
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:39,266
Wait. I see young Herr Kessler
hasn't paid his guarantee yet.

107
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,401
I think I understand unemployment
in Germany much better now.

108
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,732
People just can't afford to work here.

109
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,367
This is for railway personnel only.

110
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:00,329
Stay back!

111
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:04,291
Over here, Kessler!

112
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,266
I thought I'd tell you right away,
Kessler.

113
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,142
Car 2306 is back in order.

114
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:22,864
-Really, Herr Inspector?
-Yes, dammit, Kessler!

115
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:25,657
Your nephew is off to a great start
with us.

116
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,785
Would you please turn the handle?

117
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:29,242
Yes, Herr Inspector!

118
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,450
Track 8, Kessler. Track 8.

119
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:35,541
You'll have the honour of serving
on the first class

120
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,079
sleeper to run under the revived
company of Zentropa.

121
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:42,301
We've worked day and night to get
it back in order

122
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,926
and now it will run again.

123
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:49,349
I understand you specifically wish
to become a sleeping car conductor.

124
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,426
A fine choice.

125
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:56,561
But it's a symbolic gesture
the management has given you,

126
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:58,277
a foreigner, the job.

127
00:10:58,277 --> 00:11:01,820
We're dealing with the important
issue of human transportation

128
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,070
which no borders should prevent.

129
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,119
l, too, began as a sleeping car
conductor,

130
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,374
and believe me,

131
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,283
those were the happiest days.

132
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,586
An engine driver's work is exciting,

133
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,961
so is the systematic's in the tower,

134
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,047
but only the sleeping car
conductor is

135
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:22,427
in direct contact with the travellers.

136
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:25,046
A fine task. He can say:

137
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,516
Relax,
I guarantee you a pleasant journey,

138
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,349
sleep well.

139
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:33,133
-Right, Kessler?
-Sure, Herr Inspector.

140
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,609
I'd call this a mythological task.

141
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:40,190
You'll be accompanying your uncle
during your training period.

142
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:43,033
Your exam is in three months,

143
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,033
after which you'll be able
to advance,

144
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:49,532
but you can read all about that in
the service regulations.

145
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,446
Here it comes.

146
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:07,495
Come in.

147
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,462
Please,
Herr Sleeping Car Conductor,

148
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,202
the rails to Berlin is our best section.

149
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,885
When I was in America

150
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:22,846
I was fortunate enough to meet
Mrs. George Pullman.

151
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:28,005
She gave me this bonbon dose that
Mr. Pullman himself used to carry.

152
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:29,717
Take two!

153
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,733
And crush them...

154
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,858
...as is the custom in your country.

155
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:17,863
Attention, please!

156
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:20,324
The train for
Berlin-Ostbahnhof

157
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,871
over Bebra
Erfurt and Halle,

158
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:27,166
will be ready for departure
in platform six in a few minutes.

159
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,747
Tickets!

160
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:33,545
No, first class!
First class!

161
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,300
First class!
Tickets!

162
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,544
Tickets! No, first class!

163
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,930
First class only! No!

164
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,393
No, first class! Tickets!

165
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:10,126
Money! Please!
Please, sir!

166
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,039
Give us some money!

167
00:15:14,924 --> 00:15:15,708
Sir!

168
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:18,049
Have you got no decency at all?

169
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,684
The shades must be down now.
Those are the rules.

170
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,727
Please listen, Herr Kessler.

171
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:25,603
Things will be quiet for a while.

172
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:28,559
I'll retire now if you would be so kind

173
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,151
as to keep an eye on everything.

174
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll entrust you the passkey.

175
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:35,949
I'm in the kitchen if you need me.

176
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,742
And keep in mind

177
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:41,738
that the management's private
compartment has been taken.

178
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:43,800
Entrei!

179
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,685
You can make the bed now.

180
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,954
Sorry to disturb you, uncle.
I need some help.

181
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:05,536
Uncle?

182
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:10,918
Uncle?

183
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,988
Please, excuse me.
It's my first trip...

184
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,146
Your German is not bad at all,
Herr Kessler.

185
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,700
Please, continue.

186
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:41,829
I took the liberty of getting a bit of
information about you.

187
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,498
My name is Katharina Hartmann.

188
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:48,046
As you may know my family owns
Zentropa.

189
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:51,373
You've chosen an unusual
time to come to Germany.

190
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,923
An American in a civilian job is
a rare sight these days.

191
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:58,767
Please, excuse my curiosity but,
what are you doing here?

192
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,310
I'm a sleeping car conductor.

193
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:03,314
I'm just trying to understand why a
young American

194
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,859
wants to play tourist in these sad
surroundings.

195
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,017
I understand you refused to be a
soldier?

196
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,697
I had to come here.

197
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:13,481
Why?

198
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,615
I believe my taking on a job
as a a civilian here,

199
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,622
is a small contribution to making
the world a better place.

200
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,581
It's time someone showed this
country a little kindness.

201
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:27,042
Why Herr Kessler,
you are a true idealist.

202
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:29,255
Are you laughing at me?

203
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:35,127
No, I'm smiling because what you
say seems to come from far away.

204
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,291
What's this?

205
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:11,167
Partisans. Executed by your
countrymen, I believe.

206
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,762
But I thought the war was over.

207
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,888
Some would rather fight
a lost battle.

208
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,559
Will that be all?

209
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:25,180
No, please, stay.

210
00:19:26,985 --> 00:19:28,266
Please, sit here.

211
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,939
We are approaching a tunnel.

212
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,814
It's ridiculous, I've been on trains
all my life, but...

213
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,197
I'm so frightened of tunnels.

214
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:44,248
Could I persuade you to stay until
we've passed through?

215
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,004
Once the electric light went out

216
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:03,750
Give us a hand!

217
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:27,191
I must have fallen asleep.
It's very embarrassing.

218
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:31,160
You see, normally I have problems
falling asleep.

219
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,246
But when I hear the sound of the
wheels on the tracks

220
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:37,912
I become drowsy and I fall
asleep for a while,

221
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:43,247
and when I wake up, I'm ice cold.

222
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:46,966
It's frightening.

223
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:50,426
And then there's the feeling that
I don't know

224
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,254
in which direction
the train is moving.

225
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,685
I don't know if we're going
forwards or backwards.

226
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:00,232
Or what I thought forward has

227
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:02,025
suddenly become backwards.

228
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,146
Know what I mean?

229
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:08,909
Let me tell you, it's most frightening.

230
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:10,488
My dear uncle.

231
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:14,323
What's happened seems to me
to be a simple switch.

232
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:16,917
You lost track of things for
a moment.

233
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,159
and it was then the train was just
turned around.

234
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,172
You see?
It's easily explained.

235
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:25,798
Young Kessler, you are a fool!

236
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:38,645
You have travelled through
the German night.

237
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,732
You have met the German girl.

238
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,951
On the street above it is daylight.

239
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:56,117
But as you go on with your job
in car 2306

240
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,620
there is little to see.

241
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,675
Go deeper.

242
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,143
On the count of three

243
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,478
there will be a message for you
of great importance.

244
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:18,730
One.

245
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:20,231
Two.

246
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:21,528
Three.

247
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:25,573
Wake up! Wake up!
Leo, you have to hurry!

248
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:28,068
This invitation

249
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,288
came by messenger.

250
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,001
I don't know why but you're
invited to dinner at 7 p.m.

251
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:38,464
at the home of the Hartmann family.

252
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,962
You're already late.
Naturally I'll accompany you.

253
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,094
An invitation like this is
a great honour.

254
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:46,264
I demand that you behave correctly.

255
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:47,971
It's of the utmost importance.

256
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:51,887
The Hartmann family founded
Zentropa in 1912.

257
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:06,075
My nephew, Leopold Kessler,
has been invited for dinner at 7 pm.

258
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:09,162
He is alone to blame for his tardiness.

259
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:12,999
I turn him over to you and will myself
wait in the kitchen.

260
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,916
-They've already sat down to dinner.
-Thank you.

261
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:30,215
"...at the right hour you feed them.

262
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:34,440
You open your hand and bless all
that dwells there".

263
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,768
- Amen.
- Amen.

264
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,689
Our guest has arrived.

265
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,943
I'm so sorry I'm late.

266
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:44,158
Never excuse yourself.

267
00:24:44,158 --> 00:24:46,115
Life is too short for that.

268
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:51,038
Kat tells me you've just joined
our company.

269
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm very pleased.

270
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,338
Father's glad you're an American.

271
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:59,257
He'd like for Zentropa to be an
international company.

272
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:02,094
As Germans are ill-regarded now.

273
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:04,466
Rubbish, Larry! Let us eat.

274
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:08,849
-My sister's got her eye on you.
-Larry!

275
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:11,471
Calm down, both of you.

276
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:15,442
It's very brave of you, Herr Kessler,

277
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:18,194
to come to Germany at this time.

278
00:25:18,904 --> 00:25:22,522
A great tragedy has befallen this
part of the world.

279
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:27,120
Are you a catholic, Mr. Kessler?

280
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,704
What kind of a question is that to put
to our guest.

281
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,826
I'm afraid I'm not very religious.

282
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,839
Herr Kessler is a sensible young man.

283
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,469
He realizes that if the scars
of the war are to heal,

284
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:44,090
we have to turn to each other.

285
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:47,220
My sister says you're a deserter.

286
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:49,978
In my father's opinion, so am I.

287
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:51,306
That's enough, Larry!

288
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:55,564
My son was too ill to join the service.

289
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,194
My illness!

290
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:59,154
The illness my father's never
understood.

291
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:02,241
He thinks it stems from my mother

292
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,201
spoiling me till the day she died.

293
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:05,694
Excuse me.

294
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:10,708
I must excuse my son's behaviour.

295
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,501
I thought you didn't like excuses.

296
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:16,833
Dammit!
Excuse me, Father.

297
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:21,297
In war, life is ever so simple.

298
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:25,677
The problems arise afterwards.

299
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,599
-Don't you agree, Father?
-Yes.

300
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,565
Religion may play a great part

301
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:33,442
in times of war,

302
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:35,444
but more so when
the silence of arms

303
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,904
toys with our peace of mind.

304
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,573
When we pray to God
in times of war

305
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:44,445
we can rely on his support if only
we have faith in our cause.

306
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:47,198
Excuse me, Father,

307
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,992
but what about the other side?

308
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:54,424
The enemy believes as much
in his cause.

309
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:58,338
Why of course, Herr Kessler.
God is on everybody�s side.

310
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:02,470
But when you fight for a cause
with all your heart,

311
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,310
God finds it easier to forgive

312
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,975
if you thereby disobey
his commands.

313
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:11,899
And who doesn't God forgive?

314
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,570
The unbelievers.

315
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,324
The lukewarm ones
who don't take sides.

316
00:27:18,324 --> 00:27:21,320
They are condemned to eternal
wandering.

317
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,410
He has no mercy on them,
Herr Kessler.

318
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:30,492
"So because thou art lukewarm,
I will spee thee out of my mouth".

319
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,790
They're just about to blast!

320
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:46,225
The Allies are blowing up
cranes in Westhafen.

321
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:47,768
They're dismantling.

322
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,313
Dismantling?

323
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:53,096
They want to prevent another
German military power from arising.

324
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:59,693
So they're destroying everything
that might be of use for that.

325
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:03,117
I fail to see how the few cranes
we have left

326
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,862
might pose a threat.

327
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:08,582
The food supply situation
will become even worse.

328
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,585
You're so naive, Kat!

329
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:12,963
The cranes are loading coal
for IG-Farben.

330
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:14,966
The Americans are clever.

331
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:17,593
They get hold
of the chemical patents

332
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:19,803
and then they destroy the plants

333
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,014
to prevent any further production.

334
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:23,421
All in the name
of demilitarization.

335
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:26,686
I really admire the Americans.
Mr. Kessler?

336
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,396
Did you know that many factories
in Germany

337
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:31,231
were owned by Americans
during the war?

338
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:34,736
The Pater is praying for Mariakirche
in Westhafen,

339
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,024
so that the explosions
may not harm it.

340
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:45,037
That was that.
You may bring the coffee now.

341
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:53,458
-May I call you Leopold?
-Of course, sir.

342
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:56,592
You must understand,
Herr Leopold,

343
00:28:56,592 --> 00:28:59,054
our family has always treasured

344
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:00,846
international contacts.

345
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:05,594
Pay us a visit now and again.
How about dinner on Friday?

346
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,444
I'm afraid that's one of your fellow
Americans at the door.

347
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:16,487
Just a minute, please.

348
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:20,659
I'm sure you'll like Alex.

349
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:26,034
We studied together in Berlin
and now he's back in Germany.

350
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,916
-Colonel Harris.
-Welcome, Alex.

351
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:38,382
Max, you must fill in
this questionnaire.

352
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:43,684
May I introduce to you one
of your countrymen

353
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:46,638
who has just been employed
in our company.

354
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:50,098
Mr. Leopold Kessler,
Herr Alexander Harris.

355
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:52,806
How do you do?

356
00:29:53,735 --> 00:29:57,152
In fact it's actually Leo
I came to meet.

357
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,488
I understand you're
of German descent.

358
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:03,414
I'd be the last one to blame
you for that.

359
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:08,497
You meet so many sensible
Germans these days.

360
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:11,126
It's been a pleasant evening,
Herr Hartmann.

361
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,089
I have to go and check up on the
church before curfew.

362
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:23,803
I'm afraid we won't have time for
a game of chess tonight, Colonel.

363
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,891
-Coffee, Alex?
-No, no, later.

364
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:31,149
I've got some information on you.

365
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:34,811
I know about your AWOL.

366
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,118
I have come to ask you to do us
a small favour.

367
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:39,244
What's that?

368
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:43,332
Well, your job with the railways
could be an advantage to us.

369
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:46,001
I don't know what you've heard
about the "Werewolves",

370
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:48,629
but you should know that sabotage
is still going on

371
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,132
as well as liquidations of Germans

372
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,456
who cooperate with the Allies.

373
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:57,179
All I'm asking you to do is
to keep an eye open for us

374
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,762
and report back to us.
Here, I brought you this.

375
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,723
Excuse me, sir,
but I can't accept a gun.

376
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,105
Why not?

377
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,858
If I wanted to carry a weapon
I would've come here earlier.

378
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:13,447
I wouldn't make a move in this
country without a weapon.

379
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,486
Okay, it's a deal.

380
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:20,413
You keep an eye on the nazis for me.
I'll go and have that coffee with Max.

381
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:21,741
Colonel Harris?

382
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,875
My father apologizes

383
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,043
that he cannot bid you goodnight
in person.

384
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:27,620
He is indisposed.

385
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:36,511
Just see to it, Larry, that your father
fills out that questionnaire.

386
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,225
I've made arrangements
for someone to come

387
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:42,099
and verify it on Friday.

388
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,063
Come and sit down.

389
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,531
Father is taking his bath.

390
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:59,697
He's always retiring to his bath
when he is upset.

391
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:05,951
The Colonel is forcing him to fill out
this stupid questionnaire.

392
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:07,451
So what's it all about?

393
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:11,668
They ask you about your relation
with the Nazi party.

394
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:15,596
And father has to have
a perfectly clean record

395
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:17,589
if he wants to retain his position.

396
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:22,511
And the Colonel knows father
will have to lie to keep Zentropa.

397
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:31,935
Your uncle wants to leave now.
He's waiting for you in the hall.

398
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:36,450
Goodbye, Fr�ulein Hartmann.

399
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:39,903
There's one thing I want
to confess to you.

400
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,166
I fooled you a little the other day

401
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:49,715
when I pretended that
the tunnel frightened me.

402
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:53,547
It was the sight of those hanged
people what touched me so deeply.

403
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,474
After all they were only
fighting for their country

404
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:59,514
like most of the world
has been doing.

405
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,889
And suddenly it's a crime.

406
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,835
You have left the house.

407
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,966
Behind you is the German family.

408
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:40,227
You see before you the questionnaire

409
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:44,608
that is designed to test
the guilt of the country.

410
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,065
Friday, you will be back.

411
00:33:57,622 --> 00:33:58,737
Herr Kessler!

412
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:04,453
I'm a friend of the Hartmanns.

413
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,675
They were sure I could ask you
a small favour.

414
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,836
My nephews are going to Cologne.

415
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,005
Would you please look after them?

416
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,802
They're being picked up
at the station.

417
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:19,222
Here are their tickets.

418
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:20,976
Here you are, sir.

419
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,482
The children are with me.

420
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:31,188
O.K.

421
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:49,931
You can stay in here.

422
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:52,183
Compartment 13 has ordered
a bottle of sekt.

423
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:53,643
The name is Ravenstein.

424
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:56,520
By the way, no guests on duty.

425
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,897
I'll see to it that a fine of 7 mark
is deducted from your salary.

426
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:10,949
-Sekt for Ravenstein.
-Here.

427
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:14,290
We're celebrating.
The Allied command in Frankfurt

428
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,745
has appointed my husband mayor.

429
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,955
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

430
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:23,210
Excuse me.

431
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,264
Are you the engine driver?

432
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:30,055
I'm the sleeping car conductor.

433
00:35:30,307 --> 00:35:32,929
I don't want to impose on you

434
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:37,646
but my family and I have lived
in London during the war.

435
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:40,651
Now we're returning to Wilstadt.

436
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,394
But all of a sudden my wife is
refusing to leave the train.

437
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,731
She's very upset about the present
state of Germany.

438
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:54,374
Would you be so kind as to help
me set her mind at rest?

439
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:57,211
If you'd perhaps reassure her

440
00:35:57,211 --> 00:36:02,843
that Wilstadt has been spared the
havoc of war.

441
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:06,508
We live in Sachsenstrasse 43.

442
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:08,763
I don't know Wilstadt.

443
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,393
But what I've seen from the train
looks bad.

444
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:15,222
But you must help me.
You must.

445
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,352
I'll never get her off the train.

446
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:22,486
Our home is in Wilstadt.

447
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:24,941
Maybe we could take a taxi
from the station.

448
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:28,115
My dear, I have encouraging news.

449
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:32,160
Please, repeat what you told me.

450
00:36:32,412 --> 00:36:34,832
I don't really know Wilstadt...

451
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:40,047
But you did tell me Wilstadt
had been spared.

452
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:42,841
I've only seen it from the train.

453
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:44,917
Listen to that. Listen. Listen.

454
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:47,507
Next stop is Wilstadt.

455
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,515
You'd better get ready.

456
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:50,725
Palestine!

457
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:54,473
Palestine, Palestine...
She wants to live in the desert!

458
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:58,190
We're Jewish, but we're German,
but we're Jewish.

459
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,317
You brutes!

460
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:03,821
Leo! Help me. These people
will kill me.

461
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:04,853
What's going on here?

462
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:09,036
We have dismantling orders
for all the heaters on this train.

463
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,578
But it's freezing outside!

464
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:12,905
War debts
for Scandinavia.

465
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:21,758
It's outrageous!

466
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:22,758
Take it easy, old man!

467
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:24,427
I don't have to accept this!

468
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:27,181
We gotta give the blankets
we have to the passengers.

469
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:29,932
-We'll get the children to help.
-Outrageous!

470
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:38,233
We've got problems
with the heater.

471
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:40,061
Here are some blankets.

472
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:46,115
Persecution!

473
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:52,000
We've got problems
with the heaters.

474
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,660
Here are some blankets.

475
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:58,495
Give the children some chocolate.

476
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:04,082
Hurry up!

477
00:38:07,848 --> 00:38:10,725
We'd like another bottle of sekt.

478
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:12,517
Certainly, sir.

479
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:56,441
Security check before
the zone crossing.

480
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,269
Can we see the passenger list?

481
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,642
Sure.

482
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:14,958
Here we are.

483
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:20,594
You got the newly appointed mayor
Ravenstein and wife in 13.

484
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:21,543
Thank you.

485
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:27,301
Have another piece.

486
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,852
Security check before
the zone crossing.

487
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,270
Chocolate?

488
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,912
Security check before
the zone crossing.

489
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:48,536
Papers, please.

490
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:11,018
This paper has expired.

491
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,889
Do you have another paper?

492
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:19,404
You can't cross
the zone with this.

493
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:21,314
This guy's ID is no good.

494
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:29,453
No!

495
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,623
No!

496
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:34,082
No!

497
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:36,580
No!

498
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:55,102
One. Two. Three.

499
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:59,864
Four. Five. Six.

500
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:05,953
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

501
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,156
You are at a party.

502
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:16,913
Leo?

503
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:25,169
I heard about that
little episode.

504
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,141
I understand you handled it
very well.

505
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,852
-I didn't do anything.
-That's just it.

506
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:35,480
We'd have a lot less problems
if everyone behaved like you.

507
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:38,404
By the way, we've already
appointed a new mayor.

508
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:40,398
The children were brought
to me by this man.

509
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:43,071
He claimed to be a friend
of the Hartmann family.

510
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:46,703
Yeah, yeah. They're not stupid
those Werewolves.

511
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:51,707
Listen, I can hardly recognize Max.

512
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:54,004
He's been staring off that window
for over an hour

513
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:57,008
waiting for the 9.15 to come in.

514
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:58,633
It's pathetic.

515
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:02,841
I insist on a return match
today, Colonel Harris.

516
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,215
Sure!

517
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,903
I've never understood how anyone
could be proud to be German.

518
00:42:14,903 --> 00:42:18,485
If I had my way, I'd get on a plane
bound for America today.

519
00:42:20,576 --> 00:42:22,733
You probably find that
hard to understand.

520
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:26,326
To me, the war was just
a waste of time.

521
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:32,295
Just as you would feel,
if you were to attend

522
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:34,621
the good Father's mass.

523
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:38,668
The ceremony might be colourful,
yes, even entertaining,

524
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:41,808
but to an unbeliever it's just

525
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:44,060
a sophisticated way
to waste time.

526
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,227
Shoddy, when the Sacrament
is nothing but a dry cracker.

527
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:50,772
She's flirting with you.

528
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:54,312
A bit scheming, don't you think?

529
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,607
Why don't you dance with her?

530
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,194
Not today.
I'm too tired.

531
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:58,964
All right, Max, the Jew is here.

532
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:03,056
Marie...

533
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:06,977
Please fetch those silly papers
for me.

534
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:13,990
The form must be verified

535
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,564
by somebody from the resistance
or by a jew.

536
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:18,486
Those are the rules.

537
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:33,405
I must ask you whether
you know this man.

538
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,109
Max, you have to turn around.

539
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:41,874
Max Hartmann is my friend.

540
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:45,042
He fed me and hid me
in his cellar.

541
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:35,347
I won't do it anymore.
No more.

542
00:46:36,017 --> 00:46:37,298
Do as you please!

543
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:48,363
We handed out 13 million
questionnaires

544
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:51,778
and found out that eighty per cent
of the Germans in our zone

545
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,064
had Nazi sympathies.

546
00:46:56,286 --> 00:46:59,457
Max Hartmann is important
for the reconstruction

547
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:01,331
of the transportation system.

548
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:05,083
I admit I made a little private
arrangement with that Jew.

549
00:47:06,422 --> 00:47:08,926
He broke into an American
food depot

550
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,417
and he's quite thankful
I got him out of trouble.

551
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:13,263
Is it my move?

552
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:19,679
What am I doing?

553
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,355
No, I think I'll retire.

554
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:30,282
There's no need to disturb
the Father and Alex.

555
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:31,775
Good night.

556
00:47:32,493 --> 00:47:35,578
-Good night, father.
-Good night, father.

557
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:44,165
Your uncle has always
been a good man.

558
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:47,047
Don't forget that whatever happens

559
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:51,089
you must always do
what you think is right.

560
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:55,888
Never let anyone tell you
otherwise.

561
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:06,855
My dear Katharina...

562
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,498
Come, let's get out of here.

563
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:18,312
Blow out the lamp.

564
00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:19,512
What?

565
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:21,353
The lamp...

566
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:09,991
Father has given Larry this train
for one of his birthdays.

567
00:50:11,661 --> 00:50:13,121
Larry never touched it.

568
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,411
It was quite rude.

569
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,896
That thing with the questionnaire...
It was a farce.

570
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:48,325
Colonel Harris forced
the Jew to sign.

571
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:49,356
I know.

572
00:50:52,537 --> 00:50:55,988
I could see that father had never
seen that ugly little man before.

573
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:00,789
I'm sorry that father agreed to
such a farce.

574
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:22,440
You are so good
and understanding...

575
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,440
I find that a little provoking.

576
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:34,373
Allow me to test your
tolerance, Mr. Kessler.

577
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:38,294
I am a Werewolf!

578
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:48,049
Or more correctly,

579
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:52,971
I was a Werewolf.

580
00:51:56,232 --> 00:51:58,605
So now you know.

581
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:04,277
I have no doubt that my secret
is safe with you.

582
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:10,492
I was foolish enough
to get involved with these people.

583
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,202
I realized right away
it was a terrible mistake.

584
00:52:18,088 --> 00:52:19,748
But to get out was not easy.

585
00:52:27,182 --> 00:52:29,091
Maybe it was just to spite father.

586
00:52:32,104 --> 00:52:34,096
I've been very lonely
with this secret.

587
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:41,855
But it's all over now.
I have broken with them forever.

588
00:52:44,743 --> 00:52:46,569
But I had to tell you.
Don't you understand?

589
00:52:48,205 --> 00:52:50,114
Mr. Kessler, you once said to me

590
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,748
that the time had come
to show a little

591
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:56,294
kindness towards Germany.

592
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,720
Now, Mr. Kessler, I ask you
to prove your open mind,

593
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:12,769
and show a little
kindness to me.

594
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:07,532
Checkmate!

595
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,961
Yes, I'm afraid I have to admit
you've won.

596
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,118
-Again!
-Again.

597
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:18,674
You know, we've played chess
together about fifteen times

598
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:22,625
and I've beaten you every time.
Doesn't that bother you, Father?

599
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,132
It is just a game.

600
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:31,602
You know, sometimes it's very difficult
for me to understand Germany.

601
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:34,562
We've bombed you to pieces

602
00:54:34,734 --> 00:54:39,194
yet you all behave as if there never
was any war at all.

603
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:43,243
Max Hartmann and I have been
very close friends

604
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:46,913
and now I risk everything,
including a court martial,

605
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:50,081
just to help him keep
his position in Zentropa.

606
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:53,501
Do you think he knows about this?

607
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,885
Frankly,
I don't think he cares!

608
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:14,014
Damn you, Max! Get out of
that bathroom and talk to me.

609
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,443
Max, you can't treat me like this.

610
00:55:20,158 --> 00:55:23,822
Open that door and face
reality for once!

611
00:55:24,494 --> 00:55:28,334
-It's time to go home, Colonel.
- Come on, Colonel Harris!

612
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:30,327
He can't do that to me!

613
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:40,134
Papa?

614
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:43,463
Papa?

615
00:55:44,766 --> 00:55:45,798
Papa!

616
00:55:51,858 --> 00:55:52,853
Mr. Hartmann!

617
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,224
Mr. Hartmann!

618
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:05,246
"Sancte Antonius, ora pro nobis.

619
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,453
Sancte Christoforus, ora pro nobis.

620
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:13,998
Sancte Stephano, ora pro nobis.

621
00:56:14,884 --> 00:56:18,050
Sancti Joanne e Paole,
orate pro nobis.

622
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:22,012
Sancte Cosme, ora pro nobis.

623
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:24,222
Sancte Agnese..."

624
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:52,048
I don't know what happened
upstairs this evening,

625
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:54,760
but from the way that
the kitchen personnel reacted,

626
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,387
it wasn't very pleasant.

627
00:56:56,387 --> 00:56:59,015
I'm inclined to believe
that my nephew

628
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,636
bears a large part
of the responsibility.

629
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:07,560
Actually, I've taken a rather
substantial risk

630
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,019
in getting you this job.

631
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,151
My reputation is at stake.

632
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:13,488
And all this at a time when
the letter

633
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:15,815
you've been waiting for so long
has finally arrived.

634
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:19,900
This means that your application for
the examination has been accepted.

635
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:23,330
And is to be executed in
nine or ten weeks.

636
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:28,128
As the test is comprehensive
and the grading particularly severe,

637
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:29,587
I'd recommend you to,

638
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,539
as soon as you've finished
with these shoes,

639
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:36,427
go through the regulations.

640
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,442
Excuse me, Herr Kessler,

641
00:57:51,361 --> 00:57:53,990
but I found this pair of
Crockett & Jones

642
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,950
outside compartment nine.

643
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,238
I'm sure there must be
a misunderstanding.

644
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:00,079
Well, they are polished.

645
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,571
I don't think so.
Where is the chalk mark?

646
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:04,959
-Chalk mark?
-Chalk mark!

647
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:07,419
A chalk mark
on the sole

648
00:58:07,419 --> 00:58:10,256
is the passenger's guarantee that
the shoes have polished

649
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:12,633
and they've been polished
by the conductor of the car!

650
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:15,763
I can't see how a chalk mark can be
the passenger's guarantee.

651
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:19,057
No, you've come here with
your background

652
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:22,060
in American culture,
American way of thinking.

653
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,761
But I ask you kindly,
kindly, Herr Kessler,

654
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:29,776
without humility you will no get
anywhere.

655
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:32,488
Besides the guarantee,
the chalk mark also indicates

656
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:35,158
the traveller's compartment.
Take these shoes for example.

657
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,533
Where do they belong?

658
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:40,872
- Now I've lost track of...
- Ah, there you are.

659
00:58:40,872 --> 00:58:42,615
And how will you find out?

660
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:45,282
Well, I could always ask one of
the passengers.

661
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:51,174
When I return I want to see all
the shoes marked

662
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:52,799
with compartment numbers.

663
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:55,177
And under no circumstances
will I tolerate

664
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:56,969
any disturbance of the passengers.

665
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:11,274
Do you have a moment?
We need your help, conductor.

666
00:59:12,906 --> 00:59:15,442
I implore you, Herr Leopold,
please, come along.

667
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:38,381
You are being led through the train.

668
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,813
You are led through carriages
you never knew existed.

669
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,054
Be careful here.

670
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:24,482
Welcome, Herr Kessler.

671
01:00:24,482 --> 01:00:28,978
I can understand if this setup
puzzles you.

672
01:00:29,237 --> 01:00:32,404
But this sector is in
a state of emergency

673
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:36,078
and the authorities won't allow us
to give Max Hartmann

674
01:00:36,078 --> 01:00:38,652
a proper burial.

675
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:41,828
Gatherings are forbidden,
Herr Kessler.

676
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:48,504
We therefore have to resort
to this unworthy arrangement.

677
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:53,836
We'll proceed with our ceremony
in secret,

678
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:56,887
just as the Christians
in the catacombs.

679
01:00:57,977 --> 01:01:01,890
Everyone is gathering at the old
marshalling yard at Darmstadt.

680
01:01:02,146 --> 01:01:06,066
It will be your job
to stop the train there

681
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:08,392
so we can get the coffin
off the train.

682
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:16,109
I am waiting for an explanation.

683
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:29,372
You pulled the emergency brake!

684
01:01:55,662 --> 01:02:00,918
"Si iniquitates observaveris Domine,
Domine quis sustinebit?

685
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,418
Kyrie eleison.

686
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,670
Christe eleison.

687
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:07,300
Kyrie eleison. Et ne nos inducas
in tentationem.

688
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,178
Sed libera nos a malo.

689
01:02:09,178 --> 01:02:11,050
Requiescant in pace.

690
01:02:11,263 --> 01:02:12,722
Amen.

691
01:02:12,972 --> 01:02:16,602
Domine, exaudi orationem meam.

692
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:17,883
Oremus.

693
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:20,814
Filium, deus..."

694
01:02:20,814 --> 01:02:23,352
This is the American
occupation force.

695
01:02:26,613 --> 01:02:30,033
Law 1067 of the
military government

696
01:02:30,033 --> 01:02:32,026
forbids gatherings
and processions.

697
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:40,035
Please disperse and go home,
or you will be arrested.

698
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:50,003
Disperse and go home,
or you will be arrested.

699
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:55,049
The ceremony is over.

700
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:04,360
The coffin is to be turned over
to the occupation forces

701
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,317
for confiscation
immediately.

702
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:27,001
"Vivat, vivat. Vivat, vivat".

703
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,651
Go back to America, please.

704
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,995
Herr Leopold.

705
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,658
Over here!

706
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:02,835
Come in.

707
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,756
Kat is a lovely girl.

708
01:04:13,518 --> 01:04:15,011
You stay away from her.

709
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,181
I just wanted to thank you.

710
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,772
It turned out fine with my
nephews on the train.

711
01:04:24,822 --> 01:04:27,395
I don't know what the youngsters
would've done without you.

712
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:30,774
Open the door, please!

713
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:33,956
Our superiors
appreciate your help

714
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:36,043
in the Ravenstein assassination.

715
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:37,287
Please, open the door!

716
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:40,666
We have a new job in mind
for you.

717
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:43,757
Why, there is your little girlfriend.

718
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:08,193
Listen, Leo, I'm not asking you
to make up your mind right away.

719
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:23,426
I think we'll offer Herr Kessler
a ride back to Frankfurt.

720
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,924
And then we must get
the back door fixed.

721
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:29,094
It's stuck.

722
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:39,192
You love her. She is so strong.

723
01:05:39,777 --> 01:05:42,316
And yet so vulnerable.

724
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,905
I want you to go forward in time.

725
01:05:47,954 --> 01:05:50,954
Go forward
one month in time.

726
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,663
Be there on the count of three.

727
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:56,869
One.

728
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:58,369
Two.

729
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,623
Three.

730
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:06,677
You have a visitor, Herr Aspirant.

731
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:12,605
Father?

732
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:15,650
-I hope I'm not intruding.
-Not at all, Father.

733
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:16,599
Thank you.

734
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:20,062
Have you been promoted yet?

735
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:22,485
The exam is in
a few weeks.

736
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:25,778
Are you working in Munich?

737
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:29,945
At Saint Christopher church.

738
01:06:30,206 --> 01:06:36,542
I've come to ask you not to judge
Kat too harshly.

739
01:06:37,005 --> 01:06:41,383
I know she's told you about
her mistake.

740
01:06:41,802 --> 01:06:45,764
Kat is confused as there are
many others these days.

741
01:06:45,764 --> 01:06:48,387
But she is not a Werewolf.

742
01:06:48,643 --> 01:06:54,148
She repents her sins
and tries to make amends.

743
01:06:54,148 --> 01:06:58,279
She had to flee from these
people in Frankfurt.

744
01:06:58,279 --> 01:06:59,904
They stop at nothing.

745
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:03,401
Max Hartmann received
threatening letters

746
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:09,197
as his collaboration with the
Americans was no secret.

747
01:07:12,585 --> 01:07:14,378
After his death,

748
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:18,542
the authorities have confiscated
his entire estate.

749
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,673
Do you have any contact with Kat?

750
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:24,884
I really have to go now.

751
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:26,724
We'll meet again.

752
01:07:26,724 --> 01:07:30,186
Goodbye, Herr Kessler,
and Merry Christmas.

753
01:07:30,186 --> 01:07:31,646
Merry Christmas, Father.

754
01:07:34,276 --> 01:07:37,863
Herr Kessler, if I were you...

755
01:07:37,863 --> 01:07:42,359
I'd attend the Midnight Mass
at Saint Christopher tonight.

756
01:07:48,249 --> 01:07:50,870
Priests are
an necessary discomfort.

757
01:08:03,807 --> 01:08:09,143
"Sanguis Domini nostri
Jesus Christie

758
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,938
custodiat animam meam
in vitam eternam".

759
01:08:47,893 --> 01:08:53,314
"...ut intres sup tectum meum,
sed tantum dic verbo,

760
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:57,606
et sanibitur anima mea."

761
01:09:01,032 --> 01:09:03,994
"Corpus Domini nostri Jesus Christi

762
01:09:03,994 --> 01:09:07,244
custodiat animam tuam
in vitam eternam".

763
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,403
Amen.

764
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,631
"Corpus Domini nostri Jesus Chisti

765
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:19,000
custodiat animan tuam
in vitam eternam".

766
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,003
Marry me, please.

767
01:10:36,133 --> 01:10:37,000
Yes.

768
01:10:46,353 --> 01:10:48,974
With this ring I thee wed

769
01:10:49,773 --> 01:10:53,023
in the name
of the Holy Trinity.

770
01:10:58,241 --> 01:10:59,189
Amen.

771
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:32,109
It is New Years morning,
year one.

772
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,157
You are on your honeymoon

773
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,439
in the Hartmann family's
private compartment.

774
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:42,192
You have been making love.

775
01:11:43,537 --> 01:11:46,988
You have enjoyed the tenderness
of your wife,

776
01:11:47,915 --> 01:11:52,496
but now she is asleep
and you are alone.

777
01:11:55,759 --> 01:12:00,467
For the first time you experience
the fear of being on a train

778
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:03,970
with no possibility of getting off,

779
01:12:04,768 --> 01:12:09,098
and no idea of where
the journey may end.

780
01:12:15,071 --> 01:12:18,939
Stuttgart, Leipzig,
Berlin, Wiesbaden,

781
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,245
Hamm, Hannover, Hamburg,

782
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:25,032
Frankfurt, Duisburg...

783
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:50,896
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

784
01:12:56,324 --> 01:12:59,444
I'm so glad you got this
compartment for us.

785
01:13:00,537 --> 01:13:02,615
I've travelled so many times in it.

786
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:06,336
My father showed me all of
Germany from here.

787
01:13:06,336 --> 01:13:08,923
Kat, I know so little about you
and your family.

788
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:10,880
And yet you know more than others.

789
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,967
I don't believe your father could
be threatened to take his own life!

790
01:13:16,764 --> 01:13:21,224
You see, for father transport was
a sacred word.

791
01:13:22,644 --> 01:13:26,231
The most important thing for him
was that the wheels kept on rolling.

792
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:27,773
But they were rolling...

793
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:31,396
Yes, but the war made father
old and strange,

794
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:35,071
and he saw the whole of Germany
as his own model railway,

795
01:13:36,491 --> 01:13:39,827
running around and round and
round and round and round...

796
01:13:43,376 --> 01:13:45,795
And he wanted to believe
the cars were just as empty

797
01:13:45,795 --> 01:13:47,040
as toy trains.

798
01:13:49,215 --> 01:13:50,425
But although he did his best

799
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:52,093
it was not possible
to repress the fact

800
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:54,261
that Zentropa during the war
transported jews

801
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:56,752
in cattle trains
to concentration camps,

802
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,678
and American officers
first class afterwards.

803
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,388
In the end it was all
too absurd,

804
01:14:06,774 --> 01:14:07,807
even for father.

805
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:10,142
But listen, I just...

806
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,666
Jesus Christ, what a dump!

807
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:41,813
The two of you are moving
into what can be provided

808
01:14:41,813 --> 01:14:44,435
for a newly married couple.

809
01:14:47,152 --> 01:14:51,899
The place is OK with you because
she is there.

810
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:58,080
And as you go on with your job,

811
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,624
and are back on the tracks,
you feel stronger.

812
01:15:03,503 --> 01:15:09,043
One night there's a call for you in
the middle of the Berlin Frankfurt run.

813
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:14,674
Answer the call in the middle of the
Berlin Frankfurt run.

814
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:19,717
Hello?

815
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:22,558
Hello, Leo?

816
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:25,603
Kate, is everything all right?
Where are you?

817
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,568
I am at the villa, in Frankfurt.

818
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,033
-What are you doing there?
-Can you come over here?

819
01:15:32,993 --> 01:15:35,698
I'll be in Frankfurt in half an hour.
Are you OK?

820
01:15:35,995 --> 01:15:37,490
We'll talk when you get here.

821
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:05,981
Kate!

822
01:16:18,499 --> 01:16:19,579
Kate!

823
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:29,793
Kate!

824
01:16:41,816 --> 01:16:42,598
Kate!

825
01:16:56,664 --> 01:17:00,911
I'm afraid young Herr Hartmann
wasn't as cooperative as you.

826
01:17:02,087 --> 01:17:04,964
But then, one faggot
more or less...

827
01:17:04,964 --> 01:17:06,090
Where is my wife?

828
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:08,879
We've taken her to
a temporary hiding place.

829
01:17:09,178 --> 01:17:12,678
We thought you'd be more
cooperative if she was with us.

830
01:17:13,474 --> 01:17:15,477
I'm so glad you came,
Leopold!

831
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:17,601
Let's talk about your next job.

832
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:22,229
We would like to see the
Bremen line shut down tonight.

833
01:17:22,486 --> 01:17:24,738
You're a good man,
Herr Leopold.

834
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:26,448
We're sure
you can handle

835
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:27,991
a larger job.

836
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:30,912
All you have to do is place
some explosives

837
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,738
underneath your sleeper.

838
01:17:32,997 --> 01:17:36,117
The bomb will be detonated
on the Neuwied bridge.

839
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:38,248
You'll have time to escape.

840
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:41,797
I'm sorry to have to press you
like this, Herr Leopold,

841
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:43,541
for I really do care for you.

842
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,631
Remember. Tonight you're going
on the Bremen Express.

843
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,223
Attention, please!

844
01:17:50,223 --> 01:17:53,395
The Bremen Express
will depart shortly

845
01:17:53,395 --> 01:17:56,605
for Cologne, Essen,
Doden, Dortmund...

846
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,935
Excuse me!

847
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:02,517
Here you are!

848
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:07,650
-Up you go.
-Your suitcase, sir!

849
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:11,872
I've reserved compartment 3
for you, Colonel.

850
01:18:11,872 --> 01:18:13,948
Take your seat and
I'll come once we're off.

851
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:28,802
There is a package for you.
We don't approve of such things.

852
01:18:43,697 --> 01:18:44,644
Come in.

853
01:18:46,532 --> 01:18:47,943
Sit down, Leo.

854
01:18:50,202 --> 01:18:52,658
-Now talk to me.
-Well, I...

855
01:18:54,707 --> 01:18:57,957
Excuse me, I would like
a word with the conductor.

856
01:19:00,046 --> 01:19:01,327
Excuse me.

857
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:07,468
Allow me to present
the examinee:

858
01:19:07,722 --> 01:19:09,015
Leopold Kessler, my nephew.

859
01:19:09,015 --> 01:19:11,893
Herr Seifert and
Inspector Stelemann,

860
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:13,061
they are in charge
of the examination.

861
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:16,146
The examination consists of two
parts, practical and theoretical.

862
01:19:16,146 --> 01:19:18,316
First we'll ask you some questions

863
01:19:18,316 --> 01:19:21,235
and then we'll accompany you
to see

864
01:19:21,235 --> 01:19:25,615
how you handle the travellers
and the equipment.

865
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:31,079
Politeness and firmness
are the virtues of the conductor.

866
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:33,249
Please accompany us
to compartment 9

867
01:19:33,249 --> 01:19:35,127
and let us begin.

868
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:37,462
Has this examination taken you
by surprise?

869
01:19:37,462 --> 01:19:42,705
No, I was just attending
to one of the travellers.

870
01:19:43,135 --> 01:19:45,673
If you don't mind,
I'll just finnish that.

871
01:19:45,931 --> 01:19:47,553
I'll be right back.

872
01:19:49,642 --> 01:19:53,641
-Sorry about the interruption.
-So what is your story?

873
01:19:54,481 --> 01:19:56,391
Remember the Ravenstein
incident?

874
01:19:57,275 --> 01:20:01,107
Germans killing Germans,
that doesn't break my heart.

875
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:08,745
I met that man again,
the Werewolf,

876
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:10,455
at the Hartmann villa
tonight.

877
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:12,164
Yes, and...?

878
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:14,909
Excuse me.

879
01:20:29,472 --> 01:20:30,503
Kat, what's going on?

880
01:20:38,983 --> 01:20:41,319
They want you to plant
a bomb, Leo.

881
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:43,940
-Follow the instructions.
-Please, listen to me!

882
01:20:49,284 --> 01:20:53,039
-Or else her life is in danger.
-No, not if I can't tell him.

883
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:56,325
You must plant the bomb at
Checkpoint Urmitz.

884
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,839
-For Christ's sake, Kate!
-Come on, tell him.

885
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:02,008
The bomb must go off
in the middle of the bridge

886
01:21:02,008 --> 01:21:04,879
rails are under repair.
The train will go very slowly.

887
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,431
-That's all I can say.
-We don't tolerate mistakes!

888
01:21:07,431 --> 01:21:08,848
They're watching your every move.

889
01:21:08,848 --> 01:21:11,256
Don't forget!
Checkpoint Urmitz!

890
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,940
I love you!

891
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:46,263
I'm afraid the external examiner
is getting a little impatient.

892
01:21:46,515 --> 01:21:51,142
I think we had better proceed
with the examination.

893
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,036
Well, Herr Kessler,
we'd like to know

894
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:08,904
what you would do
if the cleaning man

895
01:22:09,164 --> 01:22:13,828
handed you a green card
filled in like this.

896
01:22:20,008 --> 01:22:22,970
Only a short stop
at the check point.

897
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,461
This train continues
to Bremen.

898
01:22:27,515 --> 01:22:30,849
Kessler, do me a favour,
stop messing around with me.

899
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:33,397
What sort of information
do you have for me?

900
01:22:33,397 --> 01:22:35,441
Is it that brown bag
you wanted me to see?

901
01:22:35,441 --> 01:22:37,683
The situation is a bit more
complicated than I thought.

902
01:22:38,028 --> 01:22:39,444
Kessler, God damn it!

903
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:41,567
Can't you stay put
for a minute?

904
01:22:41,865 --> 01:22:42,694
Excuse me!

905
01:22:45,953 --> 01:22:46,984
Excuse me!

906
01:22:55,755 --> 01:22:57,166
On your way to the platform?

907
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:02,542
Excuse me!

908
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:14,096
Jesus Christ!

909
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:40,277
-There's something I gotta tell you!
-Where is your cap?

910
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,580
I don't have the authority
to decide if this examination

911
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,665
can proceed without you
wearing your cap.

912
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,125
But I know that if you want
to carry out the job

913
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:51,162
of a sleeping car conductor
with your head uncovered,

914
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,423
I have no choice but
to put you off the train immediately.

915
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:55,883
There's something I gotta tell you.

916
01:24:55,883 --> 01:25:00,178
The last thing I desire is
private conversation on duty.

917
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:29,282
You have carried out the orders.

918
01:25:31,546 --> 01:25:33,206
Now relax.

919
01:25:34,799 --> 01:25:40,470
I want you to sink down into the
soft cool grass on the railbed.

920
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:42,679
Look up.

921
01:25:43,475 --> 01:25:45,304
Look at the stars.

922
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:50,975
See how the stars resemble
illuminated cities on a map.

923
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,157
Or maybe it is
the fading lights

924
01:25:55,157 --> 01:25:56,733
of human lives.

925
01:26:00,953 --> 01:26:04,738
But you are here to help
the lights burn brighter.

926
01:26:05,082 --> 01:26:07,041
Not to put them out.

927
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:11,662
At any prize you must make
this good again.

928
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:16,842
Run for the bomb!

929
01:26:54,093 --> 01:26:54,959
Out of the way!

930
01:26:57,265 --> 01:26:58,294
Out of the way!

931
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:17,362
Hold it, boy!

932
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:39,308
Are you out of your mind?

933
01:27:39,308 --> 01:27:42,513
Get out of here!

934
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,275
Don't you want your promotion
at all?

935
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:51,196
There is a high ranking military
officer in number three.

936
01:27:51,196 --> 01:27:53,615
He has put in a complaint
about you!

937
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:55,992
This will be noted
in your exam.

938
01:27:55,992 --> 01:27:58,318
It's going to be difficult
for you now!

939
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:02,625
My nephew's behaviour
cannot be excused.

940
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:07,001
My first thought was to advise
you to cancel the exam at once.

941
01:28:10,049 --> 01:28:13,550
The exhausting run
has made you sick.

942
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,524
Do you wish to proceed?

943
01:28:25,524 --> 01:28:29,737
That is up to the examiner.
I repeat my question:

944
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,408
What would you do if
the cleaning man

945
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:36,908
handed you a green card
filled in like this?

946
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:40,041
Your clothes are soaked with sweat

947
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,163
and you are afraid
of fainting.

948
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:45,420
Come now, can't you see it's
filled in improperly?

949
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,163
Wrong and incomplete!

950
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:51,717
Your heart is pumping faster
and faster in panic.

951
01:28:52,596 --> 01:28:54,472
Can I have a glass of water,
please?

952
01:28:54,472 --> 01:28:57,976
Would you like to tell the
examinee the correct answer

953
01:28:57,976 --> 01:28:59,175
to the question?

954
01:29:00,396 --> 01:29:03,148
It's a trick question.

955
01:29:03,942 --> 01:29:05,360
The answer is:

956
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,737
Report the cleaning man
immediately!

957
01:29:07,737 --> 01:29:13,952
The green card should never be
in the cleaning man's possession.

958
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:17,956
Normally, the cleaning man
doesn't keep any papers

959
01:29:17,956 --> 01:29:18,988
for the conductor.

960
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,833
On the contrary, the conductor
must give him a receipt

961
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:25,126
upon the completion
of his work.

962
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:28,046
And which form is used
for this?

963
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:31,875
B, that is correct.

964
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:36,307
And now a question after
Herr Seifert's heart.

965
01:29:36,307 --> 01:29:41,053
What's stated in paragraph 4,
section 62 in the book of regulations?

966
01:29:42,729 --> 01:29:44,059
You cannot breathe.

967
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:48,769
On the count of three
you'll faint.

968
01:29:50,863 --> 01:29:51,813
One.

969
01:29:52,491 --> 01:29:54,326
I must inform you

970
01:29:54,326 --> 01:29:57,943
that an open collar is against
the regulations!

971
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,576
Two.

972
01:30:05,798 --> 01:30:06,747
Three.

973
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,839
One second of infinite rest.

974
01:30:14,098 --> 01:30:17,351
Your uncle was kind enough
to fetch a card for you.

975
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:21,147
We now want you
to make bed 42.

976
01:30:21,147 --> 01:30:25,097
I have put out the correct number
of bedding covers for you.

977
01:30:25,735 --> 01:30:28,196
You may begin when
I tell you to.

978
01:30:28,196 --> 01:30:32,577
We want you to make it twice

979
01:30:32,577 --> 01:30:35,370
and then we will test the bed.

980
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:37,779
Are you ready with the clock?

981
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,534
You may begin.

982
01:30:40,794 --> 01:30:42,538
The clock is ticking.

983
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,633
The clock is ticking!

984
01:30:51,013 --> 01:30:53,089
-Stop your automobile!
-Halt!

985
01:30:54,433 --> 01:30:55,976
Stay where you are!

986
01:30:56,727 --> 01:30:57,973
Come back here!

987
01:31:02,151 --> 01:31:05,485
You don't have time for that.
The clock is ticking!

988
01:31:26,968 --> 01:31:29,044
Hurry up, Herr Kessler.
The clock is ticking!

989
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:43,983
The clock is ticking!

990
01:32:12,515 --> 01:32:13,715
Thank you.

991
01:32:41,297 --> 01:32:43,841
Kate is sitting in
compartment one,

992
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:45,918
if you wish to talk to her.

993
01:33:05,488 --> 01:33:06,438
Kate.

994
01:33:19,921 --> 01:33:21,881
Excuse me, Colonel,
there must be an error,

995
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:23,376
my wife is handcuffed.

996
01:33:23,632 --> 01:33:27,679
I'm afraid there is no error,
Leo, I'm sorry.

997
01:33:31,015 --> 01:33:34,019
I once told you that your
connections with the railways

998
01:33:34,019 --> 01:33:35,975
could be of help for me.

999
01:33:37,105 --> 01:33:39,443
You couldn't know that it was
your association

1000
01:33:39,443 --> 01:33:42,113
with the Werewolf
Katharina Hartmann

1001
01:33:42,113 --> 01:33:44,270
that really interested us.

1002
01:33:45,113 --> 01:33:47,283
We needed your help
to keep track of her,

1003
01:33:47,283 --> 01:33:49,109
when we found out
it was Kate

1004
01:33:49,368 --> 01:33:53,068
who wrote the anonymous letters
of threat to her father.

1005
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:08,046
Tell the Colonel you are not
a Werewolf.

1006
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,176
Kate...

1007
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:17,270
Please believe me when I tell you
I really cared for you.

1008
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,395
What are you saying?

1009
01:34:21,154 --> 01:34:25,651
You know, they say a Werewolf
is only a Werewolf at night.

1010
01:34:26,701 --> 01:34:28,740
In the daytime it's human being.

1011
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:34,079
I know I can't make you
understand

1012
01:34:34,334 --> 01:34:37,003
what it is that makes a man
turn into an animal

1013
01:34:38,922 --> 01:34:41,627
because you don't accept
that it ever happens.

1014
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:45,838
During nights I wrote
the letters to father.

1015
01:34:47,097 --> 01:34:48,923
During days, I regretted it.

1016
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:52,601
I didn't want him to die,

1017
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:58,647
but it hurt me so much to see him
bow before the Americans.

1018
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:00,101
And Larry?

1019
01:35:04,034 --> 01:35:06,701
He must have followed me
to meeting at the villa.

1020
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,865
It was him or us.

1021
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:13,375
So our marriage was just a part
of a plan to blow up this train?

1022
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:15,950
No, that's not true.

1023
01:35:16,921 --> 01:35:18,499
I really loved you.

1024
01:35:20,509 --> 01:35:23,387
You know, there were times when
all I wanted

1025
01:35:23,387 --> 01:35:26,391
was for us to leave and forget
about Germany.

1026
01:35:26,391 --> 01:35:29,509
But, Leo, it didn't work

1027
01:35:31,145 --> 01:35:35,474
I'm sorry, Leo.
I did what I had to do.

1028
01:35:38,863 --> 01:35:40,321
But it's your fault too.

1029
01:35:41,447 --> 01:35:43,738
The bridge would have been
so easy for you.

1030
01:35:44,577 --> 01:35:45,691
Easy?

1031
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:47,864
Nothing could happen to you.

1032
01:35:48,163 --> 01:35:49,706
And all the people
on the train?

1033
01:35:49,956 --> 01:35:51,286
What people?

1034
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:55,004
Everybody on this train has been
through the war just like me.

1035
01:35:55,004 --> 01:35:57,294
You can't compare yourself to us.

1036
01:35:58,258 --> 01:36:00,630
Everybody here has killed
or betrayed,

1037
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:04,096
directly or indirectly,

1038
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:05,965
hundreds of times,
just to survive.

1039
01:36:08,019 --> 01:36:10,724
Look into their eyes and you'll see
what I mean.

1040
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:16,064
Kate, you're talking about
an awful crime.

1041
01:36:18,989 --> 01:36:22,073
But the way I see it is that
you are the only criminal.

1042
01:36:24,286 --> 01:36:25,696
I haven't done anything!

1043
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:27,656
I'm not working for either side!

1044
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:29,863
Exactly.

1045
01:36:41,388 --> 01:36:42,798
I'm sorry to say this,

1046
01:36:44,307 --> 01:36:45,975
but I've got this rotten feeling

1047
01:36:45,975 --> 01:36:48,978
that everyone's been screwing me
ever since I got here.

1048
01:36:50,689 --> 01:36:52,515
That makes me mad.

1049
01:36:53,442 --> 01:36:55,778
And now it's my turn
to say something!

1050
01:36:55,778 --> 01:36:57,271
Herr Aspirant...

1051
01:37:03,953 --> 01:37:05,496
Herr Kessler!

1052
01:37:08,457 --> 01:37:12,920
Would you please come to
compartment nine for a moment?

1053
01:37:38,489 --> 01:37:42,494
Excuse me, I was told I could
find the conductor here.

1054
01:37:42,494 --> 01:37:43,703
I have a problem.

1055
01:37:43,703 --> 01:37:46,111
Is it too much to ask for
a bit of service?

1056
01:37:46,873 --> 01:37:48,995
We must be quiet.

1057
01:37:49,584 --> 01:37:51,962
The external examiner needs to rest

1058
01:37:51,962 --> 01:37:54,915
before we proceed
with the exam.

1059
01:37:57,469 --> 01:38:00,387
Let me give you a piece of advice,
Herr Kessler.

1060
01:38:03,267 --> 01:38:06,718
In my opinion,
you have only one option.

1061
01:38:08,647 --> 01:38:10,523
As soon as Herr Seifert wakes up,

1062
01:38:10,523 --> 01:38:13,441
ask him to accompany you
as you go through the train

1063
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:18,235
and apologize to each one
of the travellers.

1064
01:38:25,914 --> 01:38:27,194
Think it over.

1065
01:38:44,559 --> 01:38:45,639
Conductor!

1066
01:38:52,067 --> 01:38:53,776
Those shoes have not
been polished!

1067
01:38:54,653 --> 01:38:56,693
Although I wanted them
to be polished!

1068
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:05,121
I'm sure those shoes
are polished.

1069
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,795
I don't think so,
I don't see any chalk mark!

1070
01:39:12,341 --> 01:39:14,380
Your problem is not important!

1071
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:19,554
You had better be careful!

1072
01:39:30,693 --> 01:39:32,194
The emergency brake!

1073
01:39:32,194 --> 01:39:34,113
You pulled the emergency brake!

1074
01:39:34,113 --> 01:39:37,158
Because I don't want this train
to go to Munich, Bremen,

1075
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:40,943
Frankfurt or fucking Auschwitz!
I want it to stay right here!

1076
01:39:46,293 --> 01:39:48,619
You'll have to excuse me.
I need some time to think.

1077
01:40:04,979 --> 01:40:06,640
Isn't this the Neuwied bridge?

1078
01:40:07,314 --> 01:40:10,019
Might be. There have been
some diversions.

1079
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:19,698
Back into your compartments!
Now!

1080
01:40:30,673 --> 01:40:31,918
Refreshments?

1081
01:40:34,177 --> 01:40:35,257
Bed making?

1082
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:38,462
Shoe shine?

1083
01:43:03,295 --> 01:43:06,331
You are in a train in Germany.

1084
01:43:07,925 --> 01:43:10,331
Now the train is sinking.

1085
01:43:17,059 --> 01:43:18,852
You will drown.

1086
01:43:22,189 --> 01:43:25,560
On the count of ten
you will be dead.

1087
01:43:27,697 --> 01:43:28,777
One.

1088
01:43:37,078 --> 01:43:38,075
Two.

1089
01:43:49,009 --> 01:43:50,040
Three.

1090
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,980
Four.

1091
01:44:16,372 --> 01:44:17,451
Five.

1092
01:44:23,378 --> 01:44:24,457
Six.

1093
01:44:33,347 --> 01:44:34,297
Seven.

1094
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:54,611
Eight.

1095
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:05,169
Nine.

1096
01:45:13,684 --> 01:45:14,763
Ten.

1097
01:45:40,253 --> 01:45:44,629
In the morning the sleeper
has found rest

1098
01:45:44,965 --> 01:45:46,793
on the bottom of the river.

1099
01:45:49,597 --> 01:45:56,050
The force of the stream has opened
the door and is leading you on.

1100
01:45:58,814 --> 01:46:02,729
Above your body,
people are still alive.

1101
01:46:26,136 --> 01:46:27,880
Follow the river.

1102
01:46:32,143 --> 01:46:34,136
As days go by,

1103
01:46:38,649 --> 01:46:40,855
head for the ocean

1104
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:47,482
that mirrors the sky.

1105
01:46:53,248 --> 01:46:55,158
You want to wake up,

1106
01:46:56,167 --> 01:47:00,416
to free yourself of the image
of Europa.

1107
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:04,170
But it is not possible.
