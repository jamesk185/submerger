00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:34,690
Hi, Germain.

4
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:37,315
Anouk!
How are you?

5
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:39,106
Fine.

6
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,023
- How was your vacation?
- Good, and yours?

7
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:45,190
Like always in Britain.
Teachers' meeting is about to begin.

8
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:46,648
I know.

9
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:49,565
- Did you see the schedule already?
- Yes I did.

10
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:52,481
- And how is it?
- 8C, a great class.

11
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:54,731
- Lucky...
- To say the least.

12
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:56,731
Read the newsletter?

13
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:01,231
Oh yeah,
equality prevails in the republic again.

14
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:03,065
The populists aren't done yet.

15
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,398
Why so pessimistic?

16
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,398
I read Schopenhauer all summer.

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,690
- Good day.
- Hello

18
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,398
Hi, Robert.
How are you?

19
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:20,523
Dear collegues, we'll begin.
Please, take a seat.

20
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:23,815
Can you hear me well?

21
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:25,523
Yes, yes.

22
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:29,981
You all got the newsletter about
the changes in school policy.

23
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,398
We are now not only a school,

24
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:40,606
but a real classical lyceÃ©,
and it's an honor.

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:47,690
In the educational work we introduce
new principles and an original direction

26
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:52,231
but at the same time look at the
traditions, For example, a school uniform.

27
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:58,815
In our highschool, there are students
from different backgrounds.

28
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:04,023
and the introduction of
uniforms is a very bold step.

29
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:12,981
I repeat. It is a bold step to
equalize all of our students.

30
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,981
Based on the play of Juan Mayorga
"El chico de la ÃºItima fila".

31
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,815
IN THE HOUSE

32
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,481
Well, how did it all go?

33
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,190
You could've come with me.

34
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:06,481
I haven't gone anywhere in ages.

35
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:09,190
But it was Bruno's funeral.

36
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,815
He's not my relative or a friend.

37
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:14,815
You could've come for my sake.

38
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,356
I saw the twins.

39
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:22,440
They were just like
Bruno described them.

40
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:26,440
I had decided not to give condolences.

41
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:29,273
But when I was leaving,
one of the approached me.

42
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,023
I don't know which one,
I can't tell them apart.

43
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,940
She told me that tomorrow she'll
come to the gallery to discuss plans.

44
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,273
- Germain, are you listening?
- Yes.

45
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:44,231
OK...

46
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,648
Shall we go to the movies?

47
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:49,481
Ok, I'll just correct the essays.

48
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:58,106
0, 6, 3, 10, wow.

49
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,648
What, are they such idiots?

50
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,398
I never had a worse class,
it's a nightmare.

51
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:06,231
You say that every year.

52
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:11,148
That's true. Listen: On Saturday
I ate pizza and watched TV.

53
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:16,398
And on Sunday I was tired
and did nothing. Period.

54
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,356
In thirty minutes a couple of sentences.

55
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,356
Two days in the life of a teenager.

56
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:24,356
Saturday: Pizza and TV.
Sunday: Nothing.

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,023
I didn't ask them to write a poem.
I asked to write about their weekend.

58
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:30,856
I wanted to see if they
write more than two lines.

59
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,565
They can't!
And here's another one.

60
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:39,273
"I don't like Sunday I love Saturday.

61
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:44,398
But on Saturday dad didn't let me
go out and took my cell phone. "

62
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:47,315
You know, Jeanne,
I started to teach

63
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,731
to instill a taste in
literature in the kids.

64
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:55,690
Whatever, cell phones and pizza.
Consumerism and ignorance.

65
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:59,065
Here's our future.
These kids are our future!

66
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,940
Philosophers and reactionaries
predict the invasion of the barbarians.

67
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:04,898
And the barbarians are here,
in our schools!

68
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,731
"How I spent my weekend.
Claude Garcia.

69
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,690
On Saturday I had my first
training with Rafael Artola. "

70
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,106
Thank you, dear.

71
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,690
"I went to it because I always
wanted to get into his house.

72
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:26,106
All last summer I watched Rapha's family

73
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:28,190
sitting on a bench in a nearby park.

74
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,940
One evening,
I spied on them from the sidewalk,

75
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,898
and his mother almost caught me.

76
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:38,481
On Friday I was lucky
- Rapha failed a test in mathematics,

77
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,315
and I offered to help
him with the homework.

78
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,398
That was, of course,
only an excuse.

79
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,030
I knew that we would go to his house,

80
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:51,315
because Rapha would never have
agreed to go to my neighborhood.

81
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,815
At eleven,
I rang their doorbell.

82
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,440
And that house finally
opened up before me.

83
00:06:57,523 --> 00:07:00,190
I went after Rapha to his room,

84
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:04,273
It was just like I had imagined.

85
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,690
We did some trigonometry homework,
I immediately tried to get away,

86
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,648
saying that I'll go get a Coke.

87
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,106
And there I was, standing in the house
that I'd dreamed about for ages.

88
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:18,106
It looked bigger than I'd thought.

89
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,606
Four of my homes would fit in it.

90
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,065
It was clean and nice everywhere.

91
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:28,898
"Enough for today", I thought
and meant to go back to Rapha,

92
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,356
but then I was attracted
to a strange odor.

93
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:35,065
Scent of a middle class woman.

94
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,231
I went towards the smell in the room.

95
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:46,773
There, sitting on the couch, intently
reading an interior design magazine,

96
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:51,065
sat Rapha's mother.

97
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:56,231
I looked at her for as long as she did
not lift her sofa colored eyes at me.

98
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:58,856
"Hello, are you Charles?"

99
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:03,315
What a voice! Where do those
women learn to talk like that?

100
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:07,106
"No, Claude",
- I answered, not meeting her eyes.

101
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:09,981
- Are you going to the toilet
- No, to the kitchen.

102
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:12,481
She went with me.

103
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:16,981
"You want ice? Take it yourself",
- she said. "make yourself at home".

104
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,481
And she returned to the
couch and the magazine.

105
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,898
And I returned to Rapha and
solved the homework for him.

106
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:28,023
Looked like he had lots of
work to do to pass the exam.

107
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,065
"To be continued. "

108
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,940
He wrote:
"To be continued"?

109
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:35,065
Yes.
And in parentheses.

110
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,690
You gave him a ten?

111
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,231
No grammatical mistakes.

112
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,606
Compared to the others,
the vocabulary is good.

113
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,190
Who is that kid?

114
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,981
Just a sec...

115
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:54,106
Claude Garcia.
I haven't yet memorized who's who.

116
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:57,231
A ten for making fun of
a friend and his mom?

117
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:01,773
This year we'll study
great French authors.

118
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:07,565
La Fontaine, great master,
combined form and content.

119
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:10,523
You will learn how to write,
express your thoughts

120
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:14,106
and to express yourselves
through the written word.

121
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:18,023
And don't forget. For Monday
- an essay using these words.

122
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:20,773
And try to write at least something.

123
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:25,065
Spend at least an hour with a book.
And not with your cellphones.

124
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,731
I believe in you and rely on you.
Read a book. Be curious.

125
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,356
- You wanted to see me sir?
- Yes.

126
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,981
This essay on your weekend...

127
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,065
You wrote it yourself?

128
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,023
Yeah, so?

129
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,981
Weird essay.
Get it, please.

130
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:48,190
Sure, punctuation errors?
I always put the colon in the wrong place.

131
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:50,773
No, the punctuation is fine.

132
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:55,106
I'm better with math, but this year
I decided to work on my French.

133
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,856
Here the problem is the content.

134
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:02,231
You're writing about a classmate
and his family. It's not ethical.

135
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,190
Did you give it to someone else?

136
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,815
Not yet,
but I thought about showing it to him...

137
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,231
to the principal...

138
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:11,106
But I didn't write it for him,
but to you.

139
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:15,565
And how would Rapha like
to read something like this?

140
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:21,065
"... I was attracted to a strange odor.
Scent of a middle class woman".

141
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:25,023
But worst of all is that which I can
read between the lines. Your tone.

142
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:28,273
How would Rapha feel if you read
this in front of the classroom?

143
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:31,398
I don't know.
You asked to write about our weekends.

144
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,981
I do not understand what
you're trying to do, but okay.

145
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,398
you can go.

146
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,856
Sir, can I return the
essay with the words?

147
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:46,440
- It's due on Monday.
- But I wrote it already.

148
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,273
I guessed that we have to use the words

149
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,981
that you wrote on the board.

150
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:56,023
But I didn't understand if we have
to keep the order of the words.

151
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,481
Not necessary.

152
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:01,481
And if we could use the
words more than one time?

153
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:04,440
you can. Return it on Monday.
Check for mistakes.

154
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:09,648
No, better right now.
I'll do math on the weekend. Bye.

155
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,273
"Write and essay using
the following words:

156
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:28,856
happy, other, normal, good,
focused, small, fantastic.

157
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,065
Hi, Rapha.

158
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:35,148
On Monday I suggested to Rapha to
work together again on trigonometry.

159
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,231
he was happy,
and again invited me to his home.

160
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,273
Well, are you coming tonight?

161
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:47,065
Rapha. Why Rapha?
Why that normal, sweet guy?

162
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:49,898
Because he's different.
He's normal.

163
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:54,690
Lot's of normal guys around,
but something in just him attracted me.

164
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,981
The previous year I noticed, that after
class his parents often picked him up.

165
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:10,023
Always together,
holding each other's hand.

166
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:17,106
Other guys would be ashamed
of their parents picking them up.

167
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:21,231
But not Rapha.
He didn't mind at all.

168
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:24,731
And then I thought:
"What's his home like?"

169
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,940
What can a house of such
a normal family be like?

170
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,148
- Good day Mr. Andre!.
- Hello Rapha!

171
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,981
On the way we chatted just
what normal kids chat about.

172
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:40,148
About girls, sport, basketball... cars,
and plans for the future.

173
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:45,231
And so in conversation we got to
the end of our journey. To his home.

174
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,148
Gallery "Minotaur's Labyrinth"

175
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,273
Do you think it's for perverts?

176
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,106
I don't know.

177
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:10,030
The twins said so.
After all nobody's buying.

178
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:13,398
And if they bought,
they'd recognize this masterpiece.

179
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:17,315
Butcher shop, gallery
- the provincial cows don't care!

180
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:20,690
You know what I like.
In paintings I find the faces interesting.

181
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:23,815
If in the paintings are
only bare bottoms...

182
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,273
Germaine, I just don't care.

183
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,446
Spare me your theories of Modern Art.

184
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:32,773
Just tell me, what are those twins?
Stupid fools!

185
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:35,106
Stupid fools want to
close down the gallery?

186
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,065
I have a month to make
that business profitable.

187
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,065
Find something to sell.

188
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:44,690
If not, they'll end the contract
and then the gallery's finished!

189
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,190
And how was your day?

190
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:53,190
Mine? Like usual.
Chatted with the young man.

191
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,440
And?

192
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:58,148
Well, we talked and he
gave me the next essay.

193
00:13:58,231 --> 00:13:59,815
And?

194
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:05,981
The same. Second chapter. You
remember he warned? To be continued.

195
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,106
- You have it with you?
- Yes.

196
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,523
You don't want to show me?

197
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:13,773
I don't know if it's worth it.

198
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:16,815
I've read the essays of your
students for ten years.

199
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,606
It's great that you're helping me.

200
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,106
When we entered, Rapha's mom was
in the living room with...

201
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,106
...a magazine and a tape measure.

202
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:27,356
Hi, mom.

203
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:30,273
She didn't notice at first,
she was so preoccupied.

204
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:32,356
- Everything ok?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,523
On the TV,
next to a chinese dragon,

206
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:36,315
there was a foto of the "holy" family.

207
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,856
And the dragon looked at
them with hungry eyes.

208
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,398
- And your friend?
- Claude.

209
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,190
- Hello
- Hello, Claude

210
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,690
- How are you doing?
- A four in math.

211
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,065
...Said Rapha:
"Thanks to Claude! Four!"

212
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:49,315
Fantastic!
Would you like something to eat?

213
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,856
I would!

214
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,731
- I bought fresh bread.
- Cool.

215
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,731
- Chocolate spread in the cupboard.
- OK.

216
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,273
Eat.

217
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:00,106
And she floated back to the living room
with her magazine and tape measure,

218
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,356
hovering above the floor
like a disembodied spirit,

219
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,231
but through her dress,
all the curves of her body could be seen,

220
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,981
the middle class woman.

221
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,606
"To be continued. "

222
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:13,690
Awkward feeling.

223
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:15,023
Why?

224
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:18,523
It doesn't bother you that a
16-year-old guy writes like that?

225
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:19,815
With such irony?

226
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:21,231
Yes, but not really.

227
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:24,127
No more than your sex
shop with rubber dolls.

228
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:26,940
It's not a sex shop Germaine,
it's a gallery!

229
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,440
Yeah yeah, overthrowing the ideals.
Sex and dictators.

230
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,940
Exactly.
Dictators of sex.

231
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,315
You have to talk with the principal.

232
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:40,023
About "the curves of the body
of a middle class woman"?

233
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,023
Or ask for advice from
his other teachers.

234
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:45,481
And with his parents.
Really, with his parents.

235
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,613
So they'd stop him from going there?

236
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:51,690
Not with Rapha's parents,
his own parents.

237
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,523
Claude's.

238
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:56,315
He needs a psychologist.
He might become dangerous.

239
00:15:56,398 --> 00:16:01,731
He's just a rebel. Reality makes him mad.
And who'd blame him for that?

240
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:06,106
It's better to let it out in
words than to blow up cars.

241
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,481
Maybe he has problems,
and he wants your attention.

242
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:11,440
What does he look like?

243
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,315
I'd say normal.

244
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:15,106
And how does he act in class?

245
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,648
Normal, sits quietly.
And always in the back.

246
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,856
Just like you.

247
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,481
Well it's the best place in the room.
You see everyone and nobody sees you.

248
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:28,356
- Hello
- Hi

249
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:29,898
Good day, Germaine.

250
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:34,065
Hi, Anouk.

251
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:35,940
Germaine!

252
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,815
- How's it going?
- Not bad.

253
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,940
The beginning of the school year
is a hard time for everyone.

254
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:43,606
Can you show the records
of a certain student?

255
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:46,481
- Yeah, sure. Which class?
- 8C

256
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:49,648
OK, 8C,
name of the student?

257
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:52,731
- Claude Garcia.
- Claude Garcia...

258
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,690
Yeah yeah,
I see, here!

259
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:59,731
Modest character...

260
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:03,273
In the city for twelve years...
Often moved...

261
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,190
Only child,
no mother...

262
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:09,148
Father unemployed due to injury

263
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,273
an accident at work.

264
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:26,190
"How wonderful could be this house.

265
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,773
Watch the use of adjectives.

266
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:32,606
And the rest is good.
And I brought you something to read.

267
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,196
This my own book,
not from the library.

268
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,940
so you can not write in them,
bend or break the cover page.

269
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,315
All I've read before,
was a bit shorter.

270
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,815
Read the first page.
If you don't like it, return it.

271
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:52,690
And if you don't like it,
return it.

272
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,440
"Once again,
entering in a normal family home,

273
00:17:55,523 --> 00:18:00,815
I once again found a friend called
Rapha who was not good at math.

274
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,273
What?

275
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:05,565
- Look: Here we have
- from negative infinity to zero,

276
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:08,148
And here,
from zero to positive infinity.

277
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,565
You're workin as a team?

278
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,356
Exchanging information?

279
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:16,023
You're sharing responsibility and powers?

280
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,148
I'll give you a pass,
you make a move and shoot!

281
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,148
288 Tonight the Grizzlies
is playing the Clippers.

282
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,190
- Should we order pizza?
- Awesome!

283
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:26,440
- Four cheeses and salami?
- Four cheeses and salami!

284
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,648
- You staying, Charles?
- My name is Claude.

285
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:33,565
I'm taking a shower.

286
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:34,690
Bye, guys!

287
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:36,148
OK

288
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:40,315
"I accept the offer of the
healthy fellow in a track suit. "

289
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:43,398
- Your dad's fun.
- He's cool.

290
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,815
While Rapha jr. is fighting the X's

291
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:49,273
I'm imagining how Rapha
Sr. is taking a shower.

292
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:51,273
They're both called Rapha.

293
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,815
An hour later we go to the living room
and I don't immediately recognize his dad.

294
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,523
Who's now without the track suit

295
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:57,648
that gave him a bossy look.

296
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,648
But having taken the remote in his hand he
was showing who is the master of the house.

297
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,606
They have a Chinese guy, and the Chinese
civilization is a 1000 years older than ours.

298
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:07,440
The Clippers have a Korean,

299
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,940
and the dad starts reminicing about
China, which he is obsessed with.

300
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,565
Well of course!
Oh come on!

301
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,273
And in China, it's filial respect
that is the most important thing.

302
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,440
They respect their parents. grandparents,
great grandparents and so on.

303
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,731
Ten years ago he went
to China for a week.

304
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:24,481
And now thinks he knows
everything about the Chinese.

305
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,106
At the fifteenth minute,
the star forward of the Grizzlies

306
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:28,690
is thrown out of the game for a violation

307
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,898
and on that moment,
the dad gets a call from work.

308
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,815
Hello.

309
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,981
Oh, Maurice.

310
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:38,481
Maurice is his boss.

311
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:39,690
It turns out that Rapha Sr.
It turns out that Rapha Sr.

312
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:42,731
has to meet a Chinese
client Wong Li at the airport.

313
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,565
"At such a time",
worried the wife.

314
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:45,731
How annoying.

315
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:48,356
And so, the dad leaves for
the airport to meet Wong Li,

316
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:51,273
meanwhile the Clippers are
fully using their advantage.

317
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,065
Son of a bitch!

318
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,856
- How unfortunate, but this is a parody!
- Parody?!

319
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,148
How you describe the arrival of Rapha Sr.
How you describe the arrival of Rapha Sr.

320
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:06,273
his way of speaking,
his stupid track suit

321
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:09,356
you exaggerate features of the character
to make the readers laugh, right?

322
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:10,898
Totally not.

323
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,065
It's realism then.

324
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,773
Realism, what is it?

325
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:17,565
Like shooting the reality with a
hidden camera through a keyhole.

326
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:19,023
Well no.

327
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:21,148
Then it must be stylized.

328
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:24,606
Do you write what you see,
or do you change some things?

329
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:25,815
I don't describe everything

330
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:29,023
For example,
I don't care what color the track suit was.

331
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:33,773
And why do you write
in the present tense?

332
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,273
It's a way to stay in the house.

333
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,815
Alright.

334
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:45,106
The first question a writer must ask:
Who am I writing for?

335
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:47,231
So, who are you writing for?

336
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,481
It's easy to show mediocrity in bad light

337
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:55,523
It's amusing to make fun of
those who think they are giants.

338
00:20:55,565 --> 00:21:00,440
It's necessary to put yourself in the place
of the character without judgement.

339
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:05,356
Remember Flaubert, an ideal example.
He never judges his heroes.

340
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,106
Well see tomorrow in class.

341
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:08,981
Yes.

342
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,981
Why are you helping me?

343
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:18,898
Because I'm your teacher,
it's my job.

344
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,440
But why me?

345
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,356
I hate giving compliments,

346
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,231
but you don't write so bad also
you deserve encouragement.

347
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:31,856
Thank you sir.

348
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:33,773
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

349
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:36,356
I don't understand what you're achieving.

350
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,315
That kid has a talent in writing,

351
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,773
and though it may sound grand,

352
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:43,023
I need to teach him
become a literary master.

353
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:45,648
and at the same time and
teach him morality lessons.

354
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:46,981
Morality lessons?

355
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:49,273
Literature has never
taught anybody anyhing?

356
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,606
Oh really?

357
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:53,565
Do you know what they found in the
pockets of John Lennon's murderer?

358
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,565
"The Catcher in the Rye"!

359
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,648
What did literature teach this vermin?
Nothing!

360
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:03,940
Oh of course,
your exhibitions are teachings a lot...

361
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:05,940
My exhibitions are the same.

362
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,898
They are also not teaching anything,
and I know it.

363
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,981
But they open up the beauty of things!
Wine?

364
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:17,690
"Version two. Return to the house.
We're sitting in Rapha's room.

365
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:20,648
I'm helping him prepare for
his math exam tomorrow"

366
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:22,106
Come in!

367
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:26,148
"Rapha Sr. comes in,
he's wearing a green track suit,

368
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,898
he asks me to watch together
with them the Grizzlies game.

369
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,190
On minute two the second
quarter the get three pointers,

370
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,023
and both Raphas go
crazy with excitement,"

371
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:37,565
- Beautiful!
- Totally crazy!

372
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,731
Kids...

373
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:41,148
"On the third minute the mother sits
down to watch the game together with us,

374
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,856
although she doesn't care about it at all.

375
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,940
On the seventh minute she
opens an issue of Home Ideas

376
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,981
and looks at her dream home,

377
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:50,065
in which it's her fate to some day live.

378
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,898
On the 8th minute dad
promises he'll buy a plasma TV.

379
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:56,273
And we'll put the TV here
- opposite the sofa...

380
00:22:56,565 --> 00:23:00,940
On the 10th minute Esther starts to
draw a remodeling plan of the house.

381
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:04,898
She lingers in the living room, but not only
because of her love for interior design.

382
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,773
On the 20th minute she looks
at the ceiling, concentrated.

383
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:12,981
Resolving an important decicion:
where to put the new bathroom.

384
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:16,398
On minute 20 the star forward of
Grizzlies is thrown out of the game.

385
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,190
Both Rapha's stand up
and start applauding.

386
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,065
they look insane.

387
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,481
The phone rings. Dad looks at his watch,
and reluctantly answers the phone.

388
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:25,898
Hello.

389
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:27,148
Oh, Maurice.

390
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:29,148
No no,
not busy at all.

391
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:30,523
Tell me.

392
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,856
Yeah, I'm writing it down.

393
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,481
At 2:15, Terminal 2.

394
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:39,190
What card?

395
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:40,981
Oh yeah,
with his name?

396
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,315
Wong Li?

397
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,148
After O?

398
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,231
Hotel Convent?

399
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,356
Don't worry Maurice,
it'll be fine.

400
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,898
OK!

401
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,523
And so, dad leaves for the
airport to meet Wong Li,

402
00:23:57,606 --> 00:24:00,730
and the Clippers are fully
using their advantage.

403
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,481
The middle class woman joins us again.

404
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:07,273
Apparently, she doesn't
understand basketball at all.

405
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:09,065
Kids, who's winning?

406
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,731
Clippers.

407
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,106
And aren't you happy?

408
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,690
Of course,
me and dad are Grizzlies fans.

409
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:16,898
So start being Clippers fans.

410
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:18,440
Well, Mom...

411
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,565
To be continued...

412
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:21,981
Yeah, you're right.
He has a gift.

413
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:25,648
But the second version was even
more ironic and contemptuous.

414
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,565
- You think so?
- Yeah, he's manipulating you.

415
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:31,856
You think you're teaching him literature,
but he has the lead.

416
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,148
Have you read Dostoyevsky?

417
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:39,690
A genius. He could make ordinary
small people into intriguing heroes.

418
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,940
And you probably want
to be a caricaturist?

419
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,523
But I told you that I only write what I see.

420
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,773
And all you can see is ugliness?

421
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,106
That's great, but you have to
learn to rethink it creatively.

422
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:57,856
If you don't do that,
nothing in the world will change.

423
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,898
I brought you more books.

424
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:08,231
Chehov, Dickens and the ingenous
Madame Bovary by Flaubert

425
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,190
What is in front of you?

426
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,481
Most usual things.
A kitchen clock and a fan.

427
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:21,273
Yes, usual, but not quite.
Everything has it's own quirks.

428
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:24,440
You see,
on dial there are thirteen hours.

429
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:27,190
Well yes.

430
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,690
And this, listen!

431
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:32,065
- What.
- Quiet. Listen.

432
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:38,106
It's verbal painting.

433
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,065
An artist asks the spectator
to carefully look at

434
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,773
an empty frame or a naked wall.

435
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:46,940
He draws the picture and the spectator,
or in this case the listener,

436
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:50,148
becomes the co-author:
he imagines a picture

437
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:53,231
and projects his image
in the empty frame.

438
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:54,898
The picture exists in reality,

439
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,065
but the artist, by drawing,
also destroys.

440
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:03,273
In the same way artists make
fun of the cultural industry,

441
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:06,523
that produces only tangible,
material objects.

442
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:11,815
It doesn't offer them anything
poetic, ephemeral, immaterial.

443
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:15,523
I doubt they're buying that..

444
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,440
Germaine!

445
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:19,606
I have three months until the exhibition,

446
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,398
and, if nobody's buying,
they'll throw me on the street!

447
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,398
If I have to stand naked on display
to save the exhibition, I'm ready.

448
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:31,898
Do you want to read?

449
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:41,023
I brought Rapha three problems,
an easy one, to get him excited,

450
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:43,565
a bit harder, to solve together,
and a really hard one,

451
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:45,606
so he'd be occupied for a long time.

452
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:50,356
While he's fighting with the numbers, I can
walk around the house of the normal family.

453
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,398
The Chinese are very smart.
And Maurice isn't worth a penny to them.

454
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,856
It's too little for him.
He wants at least 20%

455
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:03,106
They won't bargain
with him and I thought:

456
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:05,648
maybe I'll quit and
start my own business.

457
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,148
But work is good and they love you.

458
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:13,315
But they don't respect me.
And Maurice steals all my ideas.

459
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,648
You yourself keep
talking about teamwork.

460
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,356
Yes, but there's always the one who
passes and the one who loses the ball.

461
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,231
The Chinese proposed a
line of Barbie-like dolls.

462
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:27,898
3â‚¬/doll.

463
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,023
And in retail
- ten times more.

464
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:34,940
You can send the specs,
or just photos, and they'll copy it.

465
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:38,940
But of course,
you need investments.

466
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,113
We'll have to save.
No more antiques.

467
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:50,023
And what about the renovations?
I wanted to build the terrace.

468
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:54,648
Esther, you need motivation at my age.

469
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,565
Something must be sacrificed.

470
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:59,815
Look how much money Maurice makes,
and how much I do.

471
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,523
So please help me.

472
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:05,023
Promoting products,
establishing contacts - It's your thing.

473
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:07,356
Are you suggesting we work together?

474
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:11,273
Yes.
Together.

475
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,690
But, when Rapha grows up,
I want to work as a designer.

476
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,231
Darling, but it's for all of us!

477
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:23,815
And if it works out, you can
make all your dreams come true!

478
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:25,981
I don't know...
I'm so tired.

479
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:36,023
And what are you doing here?

480
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:38,648
Rapha is solving a problem,
I went out of the way.

481
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,440
You should go!
It's late!

482
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:46,815
She saw that I was spying, and maybe, believed
that I was looking at the watercolors of Klee

483
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:52,315
Did he hear it all,
or make it up?

484
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,148
Of course he made it up!

485
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:58,981
He stared at the paintings,
and maybe heard bits of conversation.

486
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:02,690
- It's still weird.
- What?

487
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:07,731
- Where did they get a painting by Klee
in the house? - Just a reproduction.

488
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:10,023
I don't know...

489
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:14,356
Rapha has an important
math exam in a week.

490
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,898
I think we should hire a tutor.

491
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:20,356
But the friend is working with him

492
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:26,565
He needs a real teacher.
That work is of no use at all.

493
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:29,315
But Rapha likes working with him.

494
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,856
He's weird.

495
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:34,940
Was standing in the hallway watching
watercolors, and it looked suspicious.

496
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,856
I'm tired of him hanging
out here every night.

497
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,440
Rapha should be banned
from seeing him.

498
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,606
To be continued...

499
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,106
Do you know who he reminds me of?

500
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:46,940
Who?

501
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:51,190
My cousin Andre,
he was at our wedding.

502
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:54,856
Spying on everyone and
getting some kicks out of it.

503
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,731
Some people love to look at
the world through a keyhole.

504
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:13,440
The initial surprise has worn off...

505
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,648
You look like a cousin from the province,
spying on relatives.

506
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,106
- If anyone reads this book...
- Someone else is reading it?

507
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,481
Well, no.
I haven't show it to anyone.

508
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:26,606
- And please, don't show it.
- OK!

509
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:31,065
But if someone had read this,
he would have said, this is not enough...

510
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,773
not enough conflict.

511
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:41,565
The character strives for something

512
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,606
but on his way to the target meets
certain obstacles, rivals and enemies.

513
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:52,815
Odysseus wants to return home,
but meets the Cyclops Polyphemus

514
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:55,981
The Sirens and the sorceress Circe.

515
00:30:56,023 --> 00:31:01,690
Sometimes the is a conflict not with an
external enemy, but inside the hero.

516
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:07,565
And it's not about remaking
verandas or scams with the Chinese,

517
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:11,356
I'm talking about a
deep internal struggle.

518
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:13,148
Achilles!

519
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:16,690
Either go to war or remain
home with his wife and friends.

520
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:19,940
A reader wants to know how the hero
solves the problem and reaches the goal

521
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:24,523
This is the main question that the author
should form in the perception of the reader.

522
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:29,356
What will happen next?

523
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,815
If you're writing a detective
story or a Shakespearean drama

524
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:36,106
there is one task
- to make the reader wonder:

525
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,065
What will happen next?

526
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,606
"There is no development
- complains the reader, it's boring. "

527
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,190
The reader is like the
Sultan from Scheherazade.

528
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:46,815
If I get bored,
I'll cut off your head!

529
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:49,940
And you tell an interesting story,
you'll survive.

530
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,315
The sultan is a perfect example.

531
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:55,023
People need stories!
Life without stories is worthless.

532
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:57,606
- Bravo, Maestro!
- Do not call me Maestro!

533
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:03,565
- I'm afraid that I can't write any more.
- Why not?

534
00:32:03,606 --> 00:32:06,773
The math test is soon,
and I'm sure Rapha will fail.

535
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,356
Then they'll find a tutor for him and
I'll be thrown out of their home.

536
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,481
So what?

537
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:16,981
If you want me to continue to write...

538
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:24,273
Wait a minute. You want me to
steal the answers to the test?

539
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,940
I never said that.

540
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:30,898
But Rapha can't solve equations,
he'll fail the exam.

541
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:34,898
You can write without going
to their home. Make it up.

542
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,565
I tried.
But I need to see them.

543
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:40,231
Leave.

544
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,273
Hi, Bernard!

545
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,648
Do you teach math to 8C?

546
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,231
And not only 8C.

547
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:09,690
And Raphael Artole?
Any good?

548
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:12,315
Not really,
but he tries.

549
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:15,273
And when do you have the next exam?

550
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:16,981
On Thursday.

551
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,273
I wonder what kind of
problems will there be.

552
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:28,565
I'm sorry, but since when
are you interested in math?

553
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,106
Move along...

554
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:36,690
Just a second...

555
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,940
Why didn't you come yesterday?
Something happened?

556
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:42,440
If I can't visit Rapha,
I won't visit you.

557
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:51,356
NO STUDENTS.

558
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,356
Who do you have now?

559
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,856
1D.

560
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,398
Germain, are you staying?

561
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,731
More work to do.

562
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,773
Okay.
Until then!

563
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:05,148
Goodbye!

564
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:31,981
Ten minutes left!

565
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:57,940
18!?
18 in math!?

566
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:00,023
So, you can do it,
if you want to!

567
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,773
- And you, Claude, how much?
- 18-.

568
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:03,231
Not too bad!

569
00:35:03,398 --> 00:35:05,440
"Our studies have begun to bear fruit,

570
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,898
and Rapha Sr. sees me as
a member of his team. "

571
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:10,523
Esther!

572
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,940
"The mother of the family came to us out
of the kitchen with a rag in his hand. "

573
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:15,898
- 18 in Mathematics!
- Excellent!

574
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,481
Esther...

575
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:20,106
Thank you Claude for helping Rapha.

576
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,565
Claude, will you come
play with on Saturday?

577
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:25,190
We're playing on Saturdays at
the stadium from six to eight.

578
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:26,898
The guys are great,
you'll love it!

579
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:28,356
Basketball...
I do not really...

580
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:29,356
It doesn't matter how you play!

581
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,523
- Participation matters most!
- Participation matters most!

582
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:35,273
And then we buy Coke and yell
at the referee! We have fun!

583
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:36,856
We'll take care of you!

584
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:38,940
Thanks, but on Saturday
I have stuff to do.

585
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:40,565
"On Saturday,
I was really busy.

586
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,731
But, seeing how upset Rapha was,
I was pleased to realize

587
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:45,523
now there was no threat of
losing the title of best friend. "

588
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,065
Well, 14 and 18
- An average of 16.

589
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,648
- What?
- Well done, Rapha!

590
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:54,731
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

591
00:35:59,148 --> 00:36:00,731
Everyone in the school is talking

592
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:04,606
that you're going to Germain after
lessons and sit there with him.

593
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:07,273
He teaches me literature.

594
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:09,731
Did he give you the answers
for the math exam?

595
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:11,815
How did you know?

596
00:36:11,898 --> 00:36:16,606
You be careful with him, he's strange,
and his wife owns a porn shop.

597
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,231
Can you explain me why
we are in his novel?

598
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,315
I do not know,
he lost the thread.

599
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:32,898
And what's the story
with the math answers?

600
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,856
- I can't believe it!
- What?

601
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:40,106
- You gave them the answers?
- They were on the table.

602
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:44,731
Do you realize what you did?
Are you a teacher or a petty thief?

603
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:49,190
Yes, it's bad, but it was necessary
that Claude continued to help Rapha!

604
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:53,315
- And write notes of a voyeur?
- So what? I've had enough!

605
00:36:53,398 --> 00:36:55,565
- Germain!
- Yes!

606
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:59,023
I admit that it was a risk
but who is without sin?

607
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,523
This won't happen again.

608
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:11,363
Saturday, half past five in the evening.

609
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:16,106
I'm in the park next to the bench,
on which I spent all last summer.

610
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:27,940
The path is open.
I ring the doorbell.

611
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:30,273
Of course,
this is all terribly ironic.

612
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:35,356
The door opens and she comes out.

613
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:36,773
Oh, hey, Claude!

614
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:39,231
Esther, the terribly bored woman.

615
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:42,565
They went to play basketball.
Should I call them?

616
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:46,356
No, I just seem to have
forgotten my math book.

617
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:50,190
Well, come on,
take look.

618
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:54,856
Finally, alone with Esther.
In this house.

619
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:58,648
Strange, I do not see it anywhere.

620
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:02,148
"Well, you bet. Of course,
you can't see it. I have it at home. "

621
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:07,648
"My mother had the same earrings "

622
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,315
...I said,
pointing to his ear.

623
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:15,356
"She left when I was nine.
Didn't want to live with my father.

624
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:18,190
Or with me either,
I guess... Â»

625
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:24,940
The words hit the target. The story about
my mom always gets me compassion.

626
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:27,315
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yeah

627
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,981
Contact was established.

628
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:32,273
She wanted to protect me.
Be my mother.

629
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,606
She pours me a Coke.

630
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,065
We're talking about Rapha, basketball and
about how she waasn't good at math either. "

631
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:43,148
I gave birth to Rapha,
and dropped out.

632
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,231
And now he's grown up,
and I want to study architecture.

633
00:38:47,273 --> 00:38:49,315
Or, perhaps,
to be a designer.

634
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:50,446
I feel good with her.

635
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:52,315
I felt that she needed to talk.

636
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:53,898
Time flies,
and I'm already thinking about

637
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:57,106
seeing her alone again next Saturday.

638
00:38:57,356 --> 00:39:00,440
Curtains, wallpapers, paintings...

639
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:02,940
- Have you seen our watercolors?
- Yes.

640
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:04,606
- Beautiful?
- Very.

641
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:06,231
Come on,
let's go see.

642
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:14,273
Rettung, Unterbrechung, Hoffnung. "

643
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:16,940
Scary angels.

644
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,481
Angels?
I didn't even know.

645
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,481
Just like the men,
she doesn't know German.

646
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:25,690
The watercolours are just
decorations on the wall.

647
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:28,606
And I'll change the wallpaper,
and the watercolors.

648
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,815
"Rettung means redemption.
Unterbrechung - obstacle.

649
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:34,773
Hoffnung
- hope.

650
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:39,606
Zerstorung
- destruction. "

651
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:43,356
I must go. My husband and
son are coming back soon.

652
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,356
What would they say if they
found me in the house with Esther

653
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,648
Rapha Sr's wife.
and Rapha Jr's mom?

654
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,315
To be continued.

655
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,398
It's all going to end badly.
Mark my words.

656
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,773
- No.
- You'll see!

657
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:59,398
What if one day they'll be back earlier

658
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:03,898
and will catch the mother and
the friend together on the couch.

659
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,571
What couch?

660
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:10,023
He didn't write about a couch.
You're imagining them on the couch.

661
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:13,023
It does not matter.
Rapha will kill him.

662
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:15,981
- Father or son?
- Both! They will kill Claude.

663
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,565
You look at everything too seriously.

664
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:22,815
This is nonsense.
Most of this story is in his imagination.

665
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:25,613
What are you saying?
He's got imagination too!

666
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,565
Each time, it all becomes more
real and more dangerous.

667
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,231
It's important that Claude
doesn't go in the wrong direction,

668
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:34,231
but with a good teacher he
will become a real writer.

669
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:36,565
- Don't make me laugh.
- Why not?

670
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:41,565
Is he a new Kafka?
A model student from the back row.

671
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,398
You're hopefully not going to publish it?

672
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,523
And why not? This is better than
what is published nowadays.

673
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:48,648
Well, you know...

674
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:53,273
Interesting dialogue,
nontrivial situations...

675
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:06,773
"I explain complex numbers for the
hundredth time, give Rafa a problem

676
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:12,190
and meanwhile, using the absence of
his parents, carefully inspect the house.

677
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,315
I walk into the parents' bedroom.

678
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:18,773
The intoxicating scent of a middle
class woman fills the room.

679
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,398
From a screensaver with Rapha,
Sr. some Chinese man smiles at me.

680
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:27,898
Dolls Ban Dzhan...

681
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:30,440
Coloring project Jun Jin...

682
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:33,481
Certificate of ownership...

683
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,731
Rapha's postcards from vacation...

684
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:38,773
And then suddenly...

685
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,065
X- ray image.

686
00:41:43,273 --> 00:41:47,690
This is the spine.
And, it seems, female. Yes.

687
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:49,481
This is a woman.

688
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:54,440
And in the wardrobe seven
pairs of women's shoes.

689
00:41:55,731 --> 00:42:00,690
So, I imagine Esther walking
in the park in these red shoes.

690
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:04,148
Then I go to the bathroom.

691
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:09,148
Cologne, Rapha Senior's Dior.
Eau Sauvage!

692
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,356
Blades, cream for stretch
marks, paracetamol...

693
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:15,065
Xanax!

694
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:57,606
It's me, dear.

695
00:42:58,481 --> 00:43:00,440
Hi, honey.
How was your day?

696
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:04,606
- Guess what happened
with the Chinese? - Well?

697
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,815
They made a big deal about the
percentages. And walked out without signing.

698
00:43:07,898 --> 00:43:09,190
Nightmare!

699
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,815
Maurice called me,
took the bill and began yelling at me

700
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,773
because I had chosen such
an expensive restaurant.

701
00:43:15,856 --> 00:43:17,981
He himself told me to make them happy!

702
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:19,648
And how much was it?

703
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,523
268 euros.

704
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,738
Well, pay it yourself.

705
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:25,773
It's not about the money. The contract
is finished, the end of everything.

706
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:29,023
If he had signed it,
the bill wouldn't matter.

707
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:32,023
And what will you do?

708
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:38,773
Wait and hope. That everyone forgets
Wong Li and these three hundred euros.

709
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:41,231
Three hundred?

710
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:43,315
Well, with the tip!

711
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,940
"To be continued. "

712
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:48,106
I feel bad for her.

713
00:43:48,148 --> 00:43:49,315
For whom?

714
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Esther.

715
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:52,898
It's Claude here who's worse off.

716
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:54,731
Xanax is an antidepressant, right?

717
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:57,981
And I take lorazepam.
Half of the teachers take pills.

718
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:00,523
Maybe the husband is taking Xanax?

719
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,065
The husband is just normal.

720
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:05,731
Obsessed with his stupid job.

721
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:11,148
And she has nothing.
Husband ignores her, does not notice.

722
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:20,940
It is strange that Claude still didn't
get into the computer of Rapha Sr.

723
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:29,565
It seems that deep down he
is interested only in Esther.

724
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:33,946
The secret of Esther.

725
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:37,773
Esther is no secret,
it is crystal clear.

726
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:43,981
Perhaps I am missing a part where
I explain the transformation of the hero.

727
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,731
No, everything is in place.
On the contrary, there is too much.

728
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:50,731
Too much Esther...
And the X-ray!

729
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:53,148
Sentimental manipulation.

730
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:57,356
What's next, Claude, Cancer?

731
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:03,106
The character of Claude wants
Esther but there are obstacles.

732
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:05,440
Rapha Sr.
Rapha Jr...

733
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:08,190
And the key question is:
What will happen next?

734
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:11,731
So what happens next?
He'll meet Esther in a cheap motel?

735
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:17,773
No. In the house. Everything
should happen only in the house.

736
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:22,065
Ok. You've lost the thread.
What are you writing?

737
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:29,231
Satire on the middle class? Parody
of a romance novel? Bildungsroman?

738
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:30,273
What?

739
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:33,065
You speak German.
ZerstÃ¶rung, Hoffnung?

740
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:36,231
I asked my father.
He used to live in Berlin.

741
00:45:36,356 --> 00:45:38,440
And he also told me about Paul Klee.

742
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:39,898
Is that so?

743
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:42,523
Then, perhaps, he'll also
tell you about Bildungsroman

744
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,898
which is a coming-of-age story.

745
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:47,315
I thought you'd write instead

746
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:50,356
a story about growing up
and becoming mature.

747
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:52,398
But now I don't understand
what you're doing.

748
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:55,731
Claude, please explain.
What are you thinking?

749
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:57,731
What ever you said, maestro.

750
00:45:57,815 --> 00:45:59,773
You the Sultan,
and I am Scheherazade.

751
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:02,315
I never told you to make fun of a
woman who could be your mother!

752
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,273
And do not call me a "maestro"!

753
00:46:05,356 --> 00:46:06,648
Let's go.

754
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:08,981
Hello, Germain,
how are you?

755
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:10,815
Fine, thanks.

756
00:46:11,065 --> 00:46:12,731
Well, see you tomorrow.
Take care of yourself.

757
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,273
Goodbye.

758
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:16,856
Extra classes?
That's.

759
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,023
Sure, a little bit,
The boy needs help.

760
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:21,815
That's Claude Garcia, right?

761
00:46:21,898 --> 00:46:22,940
Yes.

762
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:26,315
What do you think
about school uniforms?

763
00:46:26,356 --> 00:46:30,273
pathetic. To tell you the truth,
they are now like a herd.

764
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:32,231
And that Claude Garcia...

765
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:35,481
black sheep or a lost lamb?

766
00:46:55,356 --> 00:46:58,731
Oh, hello!
How nice of you to come!

767
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:01,190
Come in, please!

768
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:06,190
I found for the next show
a wonderful Chinese artist.

769
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:08,606
She's very talked about

770
00:47:08,648 --> 00:47:12,398
but there hasn't been an exhibition
of her work in France yet.

771
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,731
She's Chinese?

772
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:16,940
Yes, but he was born in Los Angeles.

773
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:20,752
She works in the tradition
of Chinese calligraphy

774
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:24,481
This is Shanghai Sky 1 and
this one Shanghai Sky 2

775
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:27,898
Shanghai Sky 3 and Shanghai Sky 4

776
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:32,981
What's the difference between
Shanghai Sky 2 and Shanghai Sky 3?

777
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:34,606
There are no two identical
works in the series

778
00:47:34,648 --> 00:47:40,356
Fleeting, barely perceptible, differences
have been made by computer.

779
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,481
And what do they all mean?

780
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:46,690
To me,
they represent the clouds...

781
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:49,440
and the horizon.

782
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:51,065
Yes.
Yes...

783
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:53,940
- It creates the effect of presence.
- Yes.

784
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,815
Presentation instead of representation.

785
00:47:57,981 --> 00:48:03,440
And now I will show you my favorite
- Shanghai Sky 7. It's a miracle.

786
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:05,856
Well?

787
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,315
I think,
they loved it.

788
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:10,815
Your Chinese painter?

789
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:15,190
Yes. They listened to me,
looked at everything.

790
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,356
And what did they say about it?

791
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,815
Nothing special,
but they seemed interested.

792
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:24,565
Come to the opening.

793
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,398
EugÃ©nie, I never know which
one said 30 people at most.

794
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:31,148
I don't want to pressure you.

795
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:37,648
The weakness of the gallery is not
the paintings but the horrible name.

796
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:41,690
Minotaur's Labyrinth.
It scares people off, don't you think?

797
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:46,231
I was invited for dinner to
celebrate Rapha's grade.

798
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,356
The dinner was of course Chinese food.

799
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:51,231
And the filÃ© was placed on
a "Great Wall of China".

800
00:48:51,481 --> 00:48:55,481
And we didn't quite know
if it was meat or fish.

801
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:57,773
Turned out to be duck legs.

802
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,981
Germain, my literature
teacher gave me to read

803
00:49:02,016 --> 00:49:03,940
"The Great Wall of China" by Kafka

804
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:06,606
Rapha says that he's weird.

805
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:09,690
More like irritable He loves to write,
not teach.

806
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:12,023
One can do both.

807
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:15,565
He doesn't have enough talent.
That's why he's bitter.

808
00:49:15,898 --> 00:49:19,606
Bitter?
That doesn't hurt you?

809
00:49:20,648 --> 00:49:22,356
But he's right.

810
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:24,898
Masochist.

811
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:30,398
After the news on TV, Rapha Sr.
goes for a smoke on the terrace.

812
00:49:32,523 --> 00:49:35,731
Last summer they often
had dinner on the terrace.

813
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:40,481
And now I myself am sitting here with
the father and looking at the park.

814
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:44,273
You know, Claude,
people are afraid of the Chinese.

815
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,815
Really?

816
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,231
But the Chinese are the future.

817
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:51,398
They have a huge population.

818
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,106
With his son, he talkes only about sports,
cars and basketball.

819
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,065
And with me about everyhing but.

820
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,690
More than a billion.

821
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:02,106
And it's increasing by 6 million per year.

822
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:06,815
They used have a one child policy.
But now they breed like cats.

823
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:10,440
I notice a bum feeding
pigeons and ducks.

824
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,690
If he looked at us now,
he'd think that

825
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:16,065
I'm Rapha's son.

826
00:50:18,106 --> 00:50:20,273
It's nice that you're helping my son.

827
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:23,940
I'm bonding with this man?

828
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:27,231
Yes.
And you wish to take his son's place?

829
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:30,606
And you provoke jealousy in Rapha Jr.

830
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,481
Who, as a character,
is absolutely devoid of any conflict.

831
00:50:34,523 --> 00:50:37,398
He's having dinner,
in front of the TV.

832
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,565
What does he think,
what does he feel?

833
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:41,898
You do not know what to do with him.

834
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,773
I will be frank, you totally forgot to
open up the character of the son.

835
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:51,815
- Do you have kids?
- Why do you ask?

836
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:55,398
I need to understand the relationship
between the father and the son better.

837
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,023
I have no children,
but I have imagination.

838
00:50:59,148 --> 00:51:02,898
- And you do not want children?
- None of your business.

839
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:08,565
The most important thing is to
reveal the character of Rapha junior.

840
00:51:16,065 --> 00:51:19,690
"Saturday. Despite the fact that I
wanted to stay in the house with Esther

841
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:22,815
I decided to talk to the
father and son Rapha.

842
00:51:22,856 --> 00:51:27,523
And here they are
- sweaty in shorts chasing the ball.

843
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:32,815
I watched them for a long time,
trying to imagine me and my dad

844
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:38,065
jumping and trying to throw
the ball to the basket.

845
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:41,648
But, alas.
This I could not imagine.

846
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,690
But they are doing just that.

847
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:48,898
Every Saturday Rapha Jr and Sr.

848
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,023
rejoice when the ball
goes into the basket,

849
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:53,606
and grieve when it misses.

850
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,023
Hey, Rapha,
look who's here!

851
00:52:01,065 --> 00:52:02,315
Oh, cool!

852
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:09,481
Great shot!

853
00:52:09,523 --> 00:52:10,981
So you know how to play?

854
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:13,231
I look him in the eye and say:

855
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:17,273
"When my mother left,
my father stopped playing.

856
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,148
And I also.

857
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:21,690
Come on, Claude,
you're on my team!

858
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:48,398
You were doing better in the house
Why did you go to the gym?

859
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:50,940
Now it is like a soap opera.

860
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:53,231
Want to write for TV?

861
00:52:53,565 --> 00:52:56,898
Enough explaining.
Let the reader figure it out.

862
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,398
I still worry about Rapha junior.

863
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:01,440
He's just a background for Claude.

864
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:05,231
And yet, you want to take his place.
It's clear.

865
00:53:05,273 --> 00:53:08,690
Open him up,
show me who he is.

866
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:12,030
Start with his father,
playing alone,

867
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:15,398
and finish with Claude
when he tells the son...

868
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,690
"When my mother left,
my father stopped playing.

869
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:21,940
And I also.

870
00:53:22,023 --> 00:53:23,523
It is a key to the episode.

871
00:53:23,606 --> 00:53:27,856
Slow-paced movement first
and then stun the reader.

872
00:53:27,898 --> 00:53:30,940
And the last paragraph is
absolutely not necessary.

873
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:35,273
I do not understand. If you know how
to write, why don't you write yourself?

874
00:53:35,356 --> 00:53:39,190
To be honest,
I tried many years ago.

875
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:43,731
Nothing outstanding.
Like you, though.

876
00:53:43,773 --> 00:53:48,773
But you have potential. Talent.
Try hard, and you'll become a writer.

877
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,023
Simple heart.
Gustave Flaubert.

878
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,981
So, I asked to write an essay
"Portrait of my friend. "

879
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:05,273
Who will read their essay?

880
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:08,190
Who can read their text?

881
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:14,398
As usual, no volunteers.
Then I will choose.

882
00:54:14,481 --> 00:54:16,106
So...

883
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,648
Mr. Rafael Artole

884
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:23,856
Come and read us your essay.
Come on, Rafael.

885
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:26,106
My best friend...

886
00:54:26,148 --> 00:54:29,523
Louder, please - My best friend
- Claude Garcia.

887
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:36,148
Last year, I didn't know him,
we were in different classes.

888
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,065
But this year math made us friends.

889
00:54:39,398 --> 00:54:42,106
He helps me understand
it and solve problems.

890
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:44,065
"Mathematics"

891
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:46,856
Stop it!
Quiet, please.

892
00:54:47,023 --> 00:54:50,106
I invited him to play basketball
with me and my dad.

893
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,690
but he doesn't like sports.

894
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:56,898
I respect Claude. In sports you
must respect your opponent.

895
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,648
Can't you read faster?
Quiet, please.

896
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:02,106
Earlier, my best friend was my dad.

897
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:06,190
But now I understand, that mom was
right when she said that it's weird.

898
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:07,981
How jealous!

899
00:55:08,856 --> 00:55:12,815
Last Saturday,
Claude came to play basketball after all.

900
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:15,065
And then I realized that...

901
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,565
he is my best friend...

902
00:55:20,106 --> 00:55:23,148
Silence.
Please.

903
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:28,606
Now rewrite it all on board,
we will correct.

904
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:30,981
- I felt like crap.
- Forget this idiot, concentrate!

905
00:55:31,065 --> 00:55:35,315
Is this a complex number?

906
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,440
Probably.

907
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:38,231
How can it be a complex number,

908
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:40,898
if it is on the plane,
not on the axis?

909
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,190
He humiliated me in front of everyone.

910
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:45,273
He seems upset.

911
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,648
You should not do this to him.

912
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,773
I just corrected his errors.

913
00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:52,148
We had to stop when
everyone started to laugh.

914
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,481
I want him to feel just as bad as me.

915
00:55:54,606 --> 00:55:57,981
I want to kick his ass.
Kick his ass and burn his car!

916
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,065
He doesn't have one.

917
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,356
I don't drive.
The wife has a car.

918
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:04,148
God, I'll kick his ass.

919
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:07,106
You can think of something
more interesting. What?

920
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:11,065
Write in the school newspaper.
Describe how it all was.

921
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,856
Is it you who advised him to
criticize me in "The Torch"?

922
00:56:13,898 --> 00:56:17,523
And why not?
I must reveal the character of Rapha.

923
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:23,690
I never attack the independence of "The
Torch" with its photos from school trips.

924
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:25,481
speeches in honor of retired teachers,

925
00:56:25,523 --> 00:56:28,565
and sentimental verses by students?

926
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:32,981
No way!
I'm not going to censor it!

927
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,065
Maybe just talk to Rapha?

928
00:56:36,148 --> 00:56:38,523
But he does not know that I know.

929
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:41,606
This article doesn't exist for me yet.

930
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:49,190
Raphael, come here, please.
I need to tell you something.

931
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:52,315
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

932
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:56,773
He wanted to talk, but said nothing.
Only gave me a book.

933
00:56:56,815 --> 00:56:58,898
Robert Musil The
Confusions of Young Torless

934
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,356
Don't scribble, bend pages,
or break the cover.

935
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:04,356
Maybe we will not publish this article?

936
00:57:04,398 --> 00:57:05,523
Why?

937
00:57:05,606 --> 00:57:07,940
With this book,
he seemed to apologize.

938
00:57:08,315 --> 00:57:10,023
No, we definately will.

939
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:18,065
Good afternoon.

940
00:57:21,023 --> 00:57:22,398
Hello

941
00:57:28,065 --> 00:57:31,065
"I did not sleep for almost a
week trying to understand,

942
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,898
why Monsieur Germain humiliated
me in front of the class,

943
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:37,648
forced to read my essay
to laughing classmates?

944
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,731
After all,
he told us to write about our best friends.

945
00:57:42,356 --> 00:57:44,148
But this was not enough.

946
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,065
He forced me to re-write
my essay on the board,

947
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:49,565
to supposedly fix the problems.

948
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,273
But as I was writing, Monsieur Germain
almost like stripped me naked.

949
00:57:53,315 --> 00:57:54,898
Yes.
Just like that.

950
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,648
He began to scrutinize my sentences,
one by one,

951
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,398
until the board became
completely naked. "

952
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:04,940
I decided to tell you all this so that he'd
never humiliate anyone that way again.

953
00:58:04,975 --> 00:58:07,606
and that the next time I go to the board,

954
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:10,690
I wouldn't crumble up in fear.

955
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:12,731
Rafael Artole

956
00:58:14,315 --> 00:58:16,863
- He has a reason to hate you.
Why?

957
00:58:16,898 --> 00:58:18,898
You really stripped him
naked for all to see!

958
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,231
Took off his shirt, pants, underwear...

959
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:28,190
I just called a spade a spade.
Worthless essays have to be corrected.

960
00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:32,898
But the article is well written, reasonably.
Talented boy.

961
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,565
I am sure that Claude wrote it.

962
00:58:36,106 --> 00:58:38,023
What did the principal say?

963
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:41,856
This is a fatal error.

964
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:45,940
You know the new rules:

965
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:50,398
teacher must place the
student in the heart of...

966
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,773
Knowledge...
I remember.

967
00:58:51,815 --> 00:58:54,023
Not a pupil,
but a student.

968
00:58:54,106 --> 00:58:55,940
Do not punish a pupil...

969
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:57,315
Sorry, a student...

970
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:59,898
and gently lead him
with encouragements.

971
00:59:00,023 --> 00:59:02,106
Instead of the red pen
- green.

972
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:04,315
After all red is the color of alarm.

973
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:06,773
I know all this new stuff by heart.

974
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:09,148
Could you not repeat it.

975
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,523
The boy wrote that you
sort of stripped him naked.

976
00:59:13,565 --> 00:59:18,940
Are you kidding me? Seriously!
Considering this idiotic uniform!

977
00:59:18,981 --> 00:59:23,523
Tell me one thing.
Why did you humiliate this boy?

978
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:29,481
I did not humiliate him.
I just corrected his mistakes.

979
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:32,565
That's what you pay me for!
In this school...!

980
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:35,856
Keep in mind,
as the principal,

981
00:59:35,898 --> 00:59:39,148
I have to inform the inspector
of the school board.

982
00:59:48,273 --> 00:59:49,606
Come in.

983
00:59:51,606 --> 00:59:53,898
Monsieur Artole.
Good afternoon.

984
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,106
Have a seat.

985
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:59,065
It's about my son's article
in the school newspaper.

986
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:01,856
Do not worry,
it's already forgotten.

987
01:00:02,106 --> 01:00:06,398
Rapha didn't tell me.
But acted strangely.

988
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:09,793
When I read it,
I was shocked.

989
01:00:09,828 --> 01:00:12,731
Listen.
I'm just doing my job...

990
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:14,815
I'm a French teacher.

991
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:19,565
In politics, sports and life in general
only one thing is important. Respect.

992
01:00:22,606 --> 01:00:26,398
Respect for students, partners,
superiors, subordinates, workers!

993
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,606
I understand,
but you don't need to worry so much.

994
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:30,856
because of such a tiny
embarrassing episode.

995
01:00:30,898 --> 01:00:33,815
You must not dramatize,
it's just kids...

996
01:00:33,856 --> 01:00:36,440
Education is teamwork.

997
01:00:36,773 --> 01:00:41,356
Exchange of information. The division
of responsibilities and powers.

998
01:00:41,398 --> 01:00:45,356
Yes. We pass each other
the ball and score a goal.

999
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:52,523
You publicly humiliated my son,
Monsieur Germain.

1000
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,481
My son deserves your respect.
I demand a public apology.

1001
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:19,315
- I'm so glad everyone likes it.
- Any buyers?

1002
01:01:19,398 --> 01:01:23,523
- Not yet, but it will definitely be a hit.
- Good for you, dear.

1003
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,481
- Did you see the twins?
- How do I recognize them?

1004
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:32,106
They are twins. If only they came
in and found all these people.

1005
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,440
I can't believe it!
What can't you believe?

1006
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:38,190
- That one couple.
- Which one?

1007
01:01:38,231 --> 01:01:39,690
It's Rapha's parents.

1008
01:01:39,856 --> 01:01:42,481
Are you crazy!
Them?

1009
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:43,815
Yes.

1010
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:46,898
They're not like I had imagined.

1011
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:52,648
And she's pretty.
You've seen them before?

1012
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:56,523
His father came to my school.

1013
01:01:57,398 --> 01:01:58,356
Let's go meet them.

1014
01:01:58,398 --> 01:02:00,690
No, no, no, wait!
By no means!

1015
01:02:00,731 --> 01:02:03,315
Why?
- What are they doing here?

1016
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:08,898
The middle class is interested in art.
He is interested in China.

1017
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:14,398
He is interested in cheap labor.
That's it, I'm going home.

1018
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:16,940
- Already? Why?
- I have to get up early tomorrow.

1019
01:02:17,523 --> 01:02:19,106
Wait for the twins.

1020
01:02:32,106 --> 01:02:33,898
How was it?

1021
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:37,148
- They did not arrive.
- And parents of Rapha?

1022
01:02:38,023 --> 01:02:40,106
Left almost immediately after you.

1023
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,315
- Did you talk to them?
- No.

1024
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,773
- What did they do there?
- I do not care about them!

1025
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:48,981
That was my show, Germain.
And the twins did not arrive.

1026
01:02:49,023 --> 01:02:53,565
They will sell the gallery and kick me out.
And you only have this family in your head!

1027
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:56,523
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Again, the hypocrisy!

1028
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:03,190
I invited them.

1029
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,273
The Raphas?

1030
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:13,773
Yes.
I sent them an invitation.

1031
01:03:15,106 --> 01:03:18,981
I wanted to see them.
Thought you'd be pleased.

1032
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:21,065
And, as usual,
I was wrong.

1033
01:03:21,148 --> 01:03:23,940
They are fictional characters, Jeanne.

1034
01:03:24,023 --> 01:03:26,773
I do not want to see them in your gallery.

1035
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:30,231
And I'm also fictional?

1036
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:35,106
Well, of course not.
Come here. Of course not.

1037
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:43,335
What are you doing?
It's late.

1038
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,898
I've got some difficult problems.

1039
01:03:48,106 --> 01:03:50,190
Claude, spend the night with us,
if you want.

1040
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,731
Okay.

1041
01:03:52,815 --> 01:03:54,148
Will you call home?

1042
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,273
No, not necessary.

1043
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:58,940
It was closing midnight but the
math problems still weren't done.

1044
01:03:59,023 --> 01:04:01,981
And I was going to sleep at
Rapha's house for the first time.

1045
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:04,148
My auntie sleeps here at Christmas.

1046
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:09,398
The room was weird.

1047
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:10,815
And I suddenly thought:

1048
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,648
Now I'm at the heart of
the family's personal life.

1049
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:21,440
They are mom's childhood toys.
She's saved them up to now.

1050
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:26,981
Without hands, legs and eyes. All of
Esther's dolls were crippled. Poor things.

1051
01:04:29,106 --> 01:04:31,273
- You can sleep here.
- Okay.

1052
01:04:35,565 --> 01:04:40,398
Thanks for helping me with the article.
You helped me so much.

1053
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,106
Rapha lent me one of his
shirts to use as pajamas.

1054
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:47,815
It was too big for me
and he laughed at me.

1055
01:04:50,106 --> 01:04:52,148
You're a real friend.

1056
01:04:58,898 --> 01:05:01,148
You know how I feel?

1057
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:04,023
I'm like those guys who
burned cars and looted stores,

1058
01:05:04,106 --> 01:05:05,940
I'm going crazy!

1059
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,898
Â«Rapha went to his room.

1060
01:05:12,148 --> 01:05:14,815
And I didn't sleep a wink.

1061
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:19,731
I was overcome by a strange feeling,
and I could not help thinking:

1062
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:23,648
"Is it true that all children have
nightmares when there's a thunderstorm?"

1063
01:05:35,815 --> 01:05:40,565
"I was feeling my way in the corridor
while my eyes weren't used to the dark.

1064
01:05:53,356 --> 01:05:56,273
Then I went into the
room of my best friend.

1065
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,815
Rapha slept soundly, but was
making strange movements in sleep.

1066
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:07,065
What did he dream of?
Who is he dreaming of? "

1067
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,398
Well written.

1068
01:06:12,523 --> 01:06:17,356
The hero comes to the sleeping house,
like an angel or a demon.

1069
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,440
Very well written.
But it's implausible.

1070
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:22,023
But it's true.

1071
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:24,981
It does not matter if the
reader doesn't believe.

1072
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:28,856
And what's with Rapha's strange kiss?

1073
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:32,106
Hidden desire to have a normal family?

1074
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,690
Father, mother, son...
That's Pasolini?

1075
01:06:35,731 --> 01:06:39,315
I have developed a personality for Rapha,
I thought you'd like it.

1076
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:43,106
You think I'd like it when two guys kiss?

1077
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:44,190
I don't know.

1078
01:06:44,273 --> 01:06:47,731
Forget about my wishes.
What excites you personally?

1079
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:07,585
"She smiles.
Her skin is like snow.

1080
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,606
- And her feet
- as small as a child's.

1081
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:28,606
I sat and watched them sleep,

1082
01:07:28,898 --> 01:07:31,440
and suddenly I imagined
them an hour earlier

1083
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:36,148
how they make love, clumsily, hastily.

1084
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:40,106
Rapha is still thinking about
his work and his Chinese,

1085
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:44,190
and Esther with a blank stare,
from which desire has died long ago.

1086
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:51,773
Maybe my mother too was faking in bed,
and that's why she left?

1087
01:07:52,106 --> 01:07:54,606
Why did she leave us with dad?

1088
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,106
To stop pretending and start living?

1089
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:10,523
Oh, dear!

1090
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:14,815
I was overcome with a strange feeling,
and I could not help thinking:

1091
01:08:14,981 --> 01:08:16,523
"Is it true that all children want to

1092
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:19,773
climb into bed with parents
there's a storm at night?

1093
01:08:19,815 --> 01:08:21,648
To be continued.

1094
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:29,356
They had sex in front of him?

1095
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,523
No, he was imagining it.

1096
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:38,523
At his age, such fantasies are normal.
This is completely innocent.

1097
01:08:42,481 --> 01:08:45,273
Germain, are you attracted to Claude?

1098
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,440
What are you saying?

1099
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:52,565
Since you started talking to him,

1100
01:08:52,856 --> 01:08:54,815
We haven't had sex.

1101
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,398
Yes?

1102
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:05,065
Don't be afraid.
Teachers often fall in love with students.

1103
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:10,440
He's a boy, Jeanne.
I love women.

1104
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:15,440
Maybe with age you have
developed new desires.

1105
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:22,690
He's sixteen years old.
The boy just interests me.

1106
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:29,148
He has talent. It's rare.
And I'm trying to help him.

1107
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:37,523
"Once again we are looking at the park together.
Esther is eating an apple and looking at the sky. "

1108
01:09:40,565 --> 01:09:42,273
I love autumn.

1109
01:09:43,481 --> 01:09:46,273
The landscape reminds me of a painting
by a Chinese painter that I saw.

1110
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:51,690
So simple and beautiful.
Sky with a thousand shades.

1111
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:55,606
"Today, the park is not
the same as always.

1112
01:09:55,981 --> 01:09:59,148
I remember that on Saturdays after
dinner my mother brought me here

1113
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:02,148
To play on the swings and slides.

1114
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:05,481
And now there's drug traffic here,

1115
01:10:05,523 --> 01:10:08,065
and old people do Tai Chi.

1116
01:10:08,106 --> 01:10:11,481
See that bench?
In the summer I often saw you there.

1117
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:16,231
- Do you love this park? Yes.
I like that it's close to the house.

1118
01:10:16,273 --> 01:10:20,815
You sit down and watch.
And around you it's full of life.

1119
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:24,773
I immediately fell in love with this house.

1120
01:10:25,773 --> 01:10:30,440
It seems to be in the center, but it's
surrounded by nature. Sky, park...

1121
01:10:30,523 --> 01:10:33,981
"I looked at Esther.
Her skin looked so soft.

1122
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:37,315
Like the skin of an apple.
So tasty. "

1123
01:10:40,648 --> 01:10:41,940
What is it?

1124
01:10:42,023 --> 01:10:47,190
My back hurts. Had surgery,
but it still hurts.

1125
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:53,690
I used to jog here with Rapha.

1126
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:58,356
Now I can not.
And I can not dance.

1127
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,315
"And in light of the dying day,
I imagined

1128
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:04,523
how she dances, barefoot,
on yellow autumn leaves!".

1129
01:11:04,606 --> 01:11:06,523
"On yellow autumn leaves!"

1130
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:09,398
What are you, high?

1131
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,856
Apple, is it a symbol,
or just an apple?

1132
01:11:11,898 --> 01:11:14,065
"Barefoot", "yellow leaves"...

1133
01:11:14,148 --> 01:11:17,023
- The catalog of contemporary paintings!
What?

1134
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,773
Never seen it?
I'll show you.

1135
01:11:19,898 --> 01:11:22,440
"Paintings of Feng Tang.

1136
01:11:22,565 --> 01:11:24,648
What we see in the
paintings of Feng Tang?

1137
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:28,231
Silence, born somewhere
between the east and the west.

1138
01:11:28,315 --> 01:11:32,898
Silence, overcoming the noise of the
modern world, deafening roar of time.

1139
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,690
Endless game of our perception...

1140
01:11:34,773 --> 01:11:36,190
etc.
etc. "

1141
01:11:36,231 --> 01:11:38,856
These catalogs just
rape and defile words.

1142
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,731
Just to sell.
Here, look!

1143
01:11:40,773 --> 01:11:43,856
The same disgusting stuff.
Art for perverts.

1144
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:48,690
They call it art, but for me
- this is just shit.

1145
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:51,481
And you said that to your wife?

1146
01:11:51,523 --> 01:11:52,815
Of course.

1147
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:58,231
"... I imagined how she dances, barefoot,
on yellow autumn leaves!".

1148
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,648
This is not the right approach,
and you know it.

1149
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:05,690
And I haven't yet told you how after
dinner we went to one more place.

1150
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:07,565
And Wong Li went totally nuts.

1151
01:12:07,606 --> 01:12:11,481
Got drunk and started hitting on a girl.
I barely rescued him.

1152
01:12:11,523 --> 01:12:14,023
Or they would've kicked his ass.

1153
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:17,356
Now he's saying that I disrespected him.

1154
01:12:17,398 --> 01:12:22,106
- Hang on. You've been there before?
- Never. But you must please the client.

1155
01:12:22,731 --> 01:12:25,481
Some people like museums, others
- football, and others...

1156
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:27,356
are just pigs.

1157
01:12:27,565 --> 01:12:29,481
You took him to a bar with hookers?

1158
01:12:29,606 --> 01:12:33,315
Nothing of the kind!
It's a bar with women.

1159
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:35,690
Bar with women?
I see.

1160
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:39,398
Yes, I've never been there before,
I don't go to places like that.

1161
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:42,981
Maurice goes, regularly.
But that's him. I don't.

1162
01:12:43,023 --> 01:12:44,523
I went just for the sake of business.

1163
01:12:44,606 --> 01:12:49,023
That is to say you were just working, did
not drink and did not dance with the girls?

1164
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,898
I had two drinks,
to be polite.

1165
01:12:51,981 --> 01:12:53,690
I do not believe you.

1166
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:59,565
- Oh honey...
- Do not touch me! You're disgusting.

1167
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,606
I'm sick of it, Esther.

1168
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:05,815
Always the same thing,
you never believe me.

1169
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:11,106
Here's my chance.
I can feel it.

1170
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:14,190
But somehow,
for the first time in my life I'm scared. "

1171
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,440
This is for you.

1172
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,565
I have not slept all night.

1173
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:57,356
"Even barefoot, rain is not going
to dance. " What does it mean?

1174
01:13:58,106 --> 01:14:02,815
Nothing. Try to feel it.
It means what your emotions tell you.

1175
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:08,023
You're helping my son,
he loves you.

1176
01:14:08,148 --> 01:14:10,273
And my husband loves you.

1177
01:14:10,398 --> 01:14:13,148
And what if they read it?

1178
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:16,273
I wrote it not for them,
but for you.

1179
01:14:17,606 --> 01:14:21,356
The rest I understood.
But the phrase about the rain...

1180
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,398
I do not understand it.

1181
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:26,606
"Even barefoot,
rain is not going to dance. "

1182
01:14:26,648 --> 01:14:30,981
Oh, you sly bastard.
Gave her a poem?

1183
01:14:31,148 --> 01:14:33,106
Yes, I dedicated a poem to her.

1184
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:38,023
Good job. Nobody ever wrote
poetry to her. She's a clean slate.

1185
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,065
In this house there is no poetry.

1186
01:14:40,106 --> 01:14:45,148
Throw her a couple of lines and a
metaphor, and it'll be like an atomic bomb.

1187
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:46,565
Now I see her differently.

1188
01:14:46,606 --> 01:14:51,440
I see. Our young rebel fell in
love with the middle class.

1189
01:14:51,565 --> 01:14:54,190
You said yourself,
look without judgement.

1190
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:57,273
And I'm looking.
I'll get Esther out of that house.

1191
01:14:57,356 --> 01:14:59,981
Her manner of speech
no longer irritates you

1192
01:15:00,023 --> 01:15:02,398
her smell,
her love for redecorating?

1193
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:05,940
You'll go to work,
take a loan and buy her a tent?

1194
01:15:06,023 --> 01:15:10,690
The rest I understood.
But the phrase about the rain...

1195
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:14,148
"Even barefoot,
rain is not going to dance. "

1196
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:40,148
Just what we needed!

1197
01:15:43,356 --> 01:15:47,148
What is this, a bad soap opera?
This is ridiculous.

1198
01:15:47,231 --> 01:15:49,023
You're wrong, Claude.

1199
01:15:49,065 --> 01:15:51,315
You said yourself:
listen to your desires.

1200
01:15:51,356 --> 01:15:53,398
I like to kiss her.

1201
01:16:03,106 --> 01:16:05,065
To be continued.

1202
01:16:12,606 --> 01:16:14,690
Well.
What do you say?

1203
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:18,106
It looks like a bag.

1204
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,481
It is a bag.
Hand made out of tires.

1205
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:26,815
It's fair trade. And they make backpacks,
blankets and wallets.

1206
01:16:27,356 --> 01:16:29,398
Not bad.
Well done.

1207
01:16:30,773 --> 01:16:32,627
This is also from China?

1208
01:16:32,662 --> 01:16:34,481
Oh, no!
Out of Africa!

1209
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,065
Beautiful, they'll sell.

1210
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:41,648
According to you, I'm trying to
make my gallery into a bazaar?

1211
01:16:47,356 --> 01:16:53,356
"The sun was setting, and its rays were
gently caressing her legs and neck.

1212
01:16:54,898 --> 01:16:57,981
Esther, Esther...

1213
01:16:58,565 --> 01:17:03,398
The woman who was awfully bored,
fell asleep on the couch.

1214
01:17:03,481 --> 01:17:07,398
I watched her sleep,
listening to her breathing,

1215
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:11,231
and again felt how
strongly I'm drawn to her".

1216
01:17:19,023 --> 01:17:20,231
What is it?

1217
01:17:20,273 --> 01:17:21,648
I'll go look.

1218
01:17:37,273 --> 01:17:38,815
Â«Rapha...

1219
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:40,981
Why did I chose you?

1220
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:45,648
I thought you were different.
That you're normal.

1221
01:17:45,773 --> 01:17:49,356
Then why did you do it?
Because of the kiss? "

1222
01:18:04,356 --> 01:18:05,981
- Good morning, sir!
- Good morning...

1223
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:08,065
- Rafael Artole here?
- No, sir.

1224
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,731
- Claude, do you know where he is?
- No, sir, I don't know.

1225
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:13,356
Really?
- Yes, sir.

1226
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:15,481
I'll be back.

1227
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,356
- Anouk!
- What happened?

1228
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,856
Have Artole's parents
called about their son?

1229
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,690
- No.
What's going on here?

1230
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,190
Hello? Hello, ma'am.
This Anouk Meyer from school.

1231
01:18:37,023 --> 01:18:40,023
Your son is not at school.
Something wrong with him?

1232
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,815
Yes.
Yes.

1233
01:18:44,523 --> 01:18:45,898
Yes.
Thank you.

1234
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:47,606
Goodbye, ma'am.

1235
01:18:47,648 --> 01:18:50,440
- Well?
- Flu.

1236
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,940
The lesson is over.
You're dismissed.

1237
01:18:58,023 --> 01:18:59,106
But there is still time.

1238
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:04,273
I don't care. The lesson is canceled.
Claude, hold on a minute.

1239
01:19:11,356 --> 01:19:15,481
I knew that you do not like suicide.
I changed the ending.

1240
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:19,273
You've gone too far.

1241
01:19:20,273 --> 01:19:24,773
You enter the house, get the son out
of the way, seduce the mother...

1242
01:19:24,815 --> 01:19:26,773
you confused desire with fiction.

1243
01:19:26,856 --> 01:19:28,940
So what?
You taught me that.

1244
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:33,648
If someone from school or the
Artoles find out, you're in trouble.

1245
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,356
And I am too.

1246
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,606
Should I stop?

1247
01:19:42,898 --> 01:19:43,940
Yes.

1248
01:19:44,023 --> 01:19:48,065
It's too late already.
You forced me...

1249
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:53,815
The lesson is over. Sorry, Claude,
apparently I was wrong.

1250
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,356
I remember my first day at school.

1251
01:20:09,398 --> 01:20:12,606
I wanted to throw out all the
textbooks and just run away.

1252
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:15,940
You gave us an assignment.
And you gave me a 17.

1253
01:20:15,981 --> 01:20:18,481
And now I can not stop.

1254
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:21,273
You can not?
Well then write!

1255
01:20:21,315 --> 01:20:24,731
Write about yourself,
your family, or whatever.

1256
01:20:24,815 --> 01:20:26,440
But forget about Artoles.

1257
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:30,356
But I love these characters,
you yourself have taught me this.

1258
01:20:30,523 --> 01:20:32,731
I do not want to stop.

1259
01:20:32,856 --> 01:20:34,898
Then I won't read.

1260
01:20:40,523 --> 01:20:42,106
Freak.

1261
01:21:14,856 --> 01:21:16,856
We need to talk.

1262
01:21:21,815 --> 01:21:25,148
Maurice reminded me again
about Wong Li's unpaid bill.

1263
01:21:25,273 --> 01:21:29,440
He humiliated me.
Is respect not important anymore?

1264
01:21:30,398 --> 01:21:32,023
Yes Rapha.

1265
01:21:35,065 --> 01:21:36,898
- Esther...
- Yes?

1266
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:39,815
I burned his car.

1267
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:41,190
Whose?

1268
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:42,315
Maurice's.

1269
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:43,356
Why?

1270
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,523
I don't know. Something
happened inside me, I don't know!

1271
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:54,815
I can't go on with this job anymore.

1272
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:57,148
Anyone see you?

1273
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:59,106
I don't know.

1274
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:06,523
Sorry, I know what you're going to say.

1275
01:22:06,815 --> 01:22:09,440
Please, give me one more chance.
Please.

1276
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,815
I have news too.

1277
01:22:13,773 --> 01:22:15,523
What?

1278
01:22:17,315 --> 01:22:19,273
I am pregnant.

1279
01:22:22,565 --> 01:22:26,606
Great!
Why didn't you tell me?

1280
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:29,315
I wanted to make sure.

1281
01:22:33,356 --> 01:22:35,148
I love you.

1282
01:22:44,981 --> 01:22:47,273
Rapha?
You feel better?

1283
01:22:47,356 --> 01:22:49,315
I wanted to ask you something.

1284
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:51,023
About what?

1285
01:22:51,356 --> 01:22:54,065
I need a math tutor.

1286
01:22:54,981 --> 01:22:56,773
And what about Claude?

1287
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:00,856
I do not want to see him again.

1288
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:06,023
And they smiled at each other. The normal
family is back together once again. "

1289
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,481
Come here.

1290
01:23:09,856 --> 01:23:14,190
For a year I dreamed about
going into this house. And I did.

1291
01:23:14,398 --> 01:23:16,856
And carefully studied the normal family.

1292
01:23:16,898 --> 01:23:19,606
And even wanted to be one of them.

1293
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,773
But now there is no place
in this house for me.

1294
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:30,815
To be continued.

1295
01:23:53,481 --> 01:23:55,273
What happened?

1296
01:23:55,898 --> 01:23:59,523
You know what happens when
a man betrays his team?

1297
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:01,190
No, I don't.

1298
01:24:02,148 --> 01:24:05,606
If someone offends a member
of my team, I kick his ass.

1299
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:09,731
- My dad's on my team.
- So what?

1300
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:12,356
And my mom...

1301
01:24:13,356 --> 01:24:16,981
Although she doesn't play basketball,
she is untouchable.

1302
01:24:17,106 --> 01:24:18,065
Yes?

1303
01:24:18,148 --> 01:24:23,940
And if some idiot touches her,
I'll bust his face, and his father's also.

1304
01:24:26,648 --> 01:24:32,190
And one stupid asshole kissed this idiot.
What, you forgot?

1305
01:24:37,856 --> 01:24:39,398
I thought about it.

1306
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:43,523
Happy reunion of a normal family
- it's impossible.

1307
01:24:43,606 --> 01:24:45,106
You have to finish the novel.

1308
01:24:45,148 --> 01:24:46,856
I do not write anymore.

1309
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,856
You don't visit their home anymore?

1310
01:24:48,898 --> 01:24:54,606
You said I'd be in trouble.
Now I am alone.

1311
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:58,148
There's only mathematics.
It doesn't betray me.

1312
01:25:04,731 --> 01:25:08,856
Option A:
Husband and son kill Claude.

1313
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:12,981
Option B: Claude kills them himself
and lives with Esther in the house.

1314
01:25:13,065 --> 01:25:17,690
Option C: Esther burns down
the house and all three guys.

1315
01:25:17,773 --> 01:25:20,440
Choose any finale and write it yourself.

1316
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:25,898
I can not. It's not my novel.
I do not make the decisions.

1317
01:25:27,065 --> 01:25:29,315
You know the secret of
a spectacular finale?

1318
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,773
The reader has to say:

1319
01:25:30,856 --> 01:25:34,606
"I did not expect that, but any other
ending would've been impossible. "

1320
01:25:34,648 --> 01:25:40,231
Option D: Esther repeats the phrase "Even
barefoot, rain is not going to dance. "

1321
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:46,731
Her life in this house with her horrible
husband and stupid son is unbearable.

1322
01:25:47,606 --> 01:25:50,523
It makes no sense.
She gasps.

1323
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:56,106
Esther goes to the terrace. And sees
him on the park bench. He's waiting	.

1324
01:25:58,481 --> 01:26:03,565
She runs to him.
Sits. And they kiss.

1325
01:26:06,606 --> 01:26:09,106
It's Barbara Cartland

1326
01:26:42,523 --> 01:26:44,398
- Hello, Claude.
- Hello.

1327
01:26:45,773 --> 01:26:49,023
I knew you'd come.
I was waiting for you.

1328
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:54,065
Here, take your poems.

1329
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:57,690
Do not want to throw them away.

1330
01:26:58,106 --> 01:27:02,023
I came for you.
I want to take you away from here.

1331
01:27:02,148 --> 01:27:03,148
What?

1332
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:07,106
Yes. You and me. We'll get out of town,
out of the house, from both Raphas.

1333
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,023
Impossible.
Why?

1334
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:15,606
You're a child, Claude. What was
between us was an illusion. Forget it.

1335
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,690
- It was...
- A miracle!

1336
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:22,148
So be it.
But it was a ghost.

1337
01:27:45,273 --> 01:27:47,231
We hurt Rapha.

1338
01:27:47,315 --> 01:27:49,356
- Which one?
- Both.

1339
01:27:53,648 --> 01:27:57,440
I do not want to hurt anyone.

1340
01:28:14,648 --> 01:28:17,065
No, Claude.
Stop.

1341
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:18,231
But I love you.

1342
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:19,690
No.

1343
01:28:20,523 --> 01:28:22,273
You don't love me.

1344
01:28:23,356 --> 01:28:25,106
But a character.

1345
01:28:25,398 --> 01:28:27,315
The character in your head.

1346
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:34,856
I'm going,
I need to gather my things.

1347
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:36,273
You're leaving?

1348
01:28:36,356 --> 01:28:37,606
Yes.

1349
01:28:37,898 --> 01:28:39,898
What about the renovation,
the veranda?

1350
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:45,565
Rapha quit, we're going to China.
He has a partner there.

1351
01:28:45,815 --> 01:28:50,231
We'll see what happens.
We are starting a new life.

1352
01:28:52,398 --> 01:28:55,856
Come on.
Don't be sad.

1353
01:28:57,231 --> 01:29:01,106
Goodbye, Claude.
Take care of yourself.

1354
01:29:02,981 --> 01:29:04,481
Esther!

1355
01:29:06,065 --> 01:29:08,065
I need them.

1356
01:29:36,523 --> 01:29:38,898
Today is a special day.

1357
01:29:39,356 --> 01:29:42,148
I got up at six forty-five,
as always.

1358
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,440
And as always,
cooked breakfast for father.

1359
01:29:47,773 --> 01:29:51,023
And as always,
left the house at eight o'clock.

1360
01:29:52,106 --> 01:29:53,481
Today is Wednesday.

1361
01:29:53,523 --> 01:29:56,231
English at nine,
history at ten

1362
01:29:56,273 --> 01:29:59,606
At eleven French,
then math

1363
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:03,440
But today everything will be different.

1364
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:07,065
I'm not going to school
or to Rapha's house.

1365
01:30:07,106 --> 01:30:09,148
I'll look for the finale of the novel.

1366
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:12,898
That Mr. Germaine asked for.
My teacher.

1367
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:16,065
Rapha...

1368
01:30:16,731 --> 01:30:21,773
you felt humiliated,
but it was just an emotion.

1369
01:30:21,856 --> 01:30:26,065
You're young, you'll learn.
You're like the reed in Lafontaine's fable.

1370
01:30:28,106 --> 01:30:31,273
You bend but don't break.
Do you remember?

1371
01:30:31,356 --> 01:30:33,190
The Oak once asked the Reed:

1372
01:30:33,273 --> 01:30:36,898
You're so weak that you can hardly stand
up straight in the weakest of winds.

1373
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:40,898
...and in the end... On the Wings
of the North rushed a hurricane

1374
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:43,065
His impact broke down the Oak.

1375
01:30:43,148 --> 01:30:46,106
The Reed ducked.
Hurricane did not hurt him.

1376
01:30:46,148 --> 01:30:47,773
Doubling the power of their...

1377
01:30:48,398 --> 01:30:49,815
Yes?

1378
01:30:51,648 --> 01:30:53,148
Sit down.

1379
01:30:54,231 --> 01:30:57,440
Come in, please,
to my office.

1380
01:30:57,523 --> 01:30:59,398
- Right now?
Yes.

1381
01:30:59,565 --> 01:31:02,648
- Claude Garcia here?
- No.

1382
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:04,523
And Rafael Artole?

1383
01:31:05,065 --> 01:31:06,606
You too, please.

1384
01:31:30,773 --> 01:31:34,398
"There she is. With a tired face.
She has no children.

1385
01:31:34,523 --> 01:31:36,440
I know her husband.

1386
01:31:36,565 --> 01:31:40,950
He believes in the gallery she
shows crap and art for perverts.

1387
01:31:41,315 --> 01:31:44,106
- You're Claude, right?
- Yes.

1388
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:48,023
She measures me with her gaze.
She imagined I was different?

1389
01:31:48,065 --> 01:31:49,773
Why are not you in school?

1390
01:31:49,856 --> 01:31:51,398
I decided to leave.

1391
01:31:52,023 --> 01:31:54,106
And what will you do?

1392
01:31:55,648 --> 01:32:00,065
A lot of people are bad at math.
I will give private lessons.

1393
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,273
Are you sure?

1394
01:32:01,356 --> 01:32:05,440
Yes.
Or write art catalogs.

1395
01:32:05,606 --> 01:32:07,690
Teacher says I'm good at it.

1396
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:11,690
Yes, I know.
Rich imagination.

1397
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:13,523
Can I come in?

1398
01:32:14,023 --> 01:32:15,731
Germain's not here.

1399
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,481
I know.

1400
01:32:37,315 --> 01:32:43,190
A nightmare!
Complete nonsense. Bastards!

1401
01:32:44,856 --> 01:32:47,023
Claude wasn't at school today?

1402
01:32:47,065 --> 01:32:48,773
How do you know?

1403
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,440
He was here!

1404
01:32:56,523 --> 01:32:58,565
Did you let him in?

1405
01:33:00,023 --> 01:33:02,523
Only for the chosen few.

1406
01:33:09,065 --> 01:33:11,398
So, here I am,
at his home.

1407
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,606
Going somewhere?

1408
01:33:12,648 --> 01:33:16,440
"No, I just brought your husbands books.
The gallery was closed. "

1409
01:33:16,481 --> 01:33:18,565
And I began to unpack the books.

1410
01:33:19,148 --> 01:33:21,565
They need to be put
on the shelf for ages.

1411
01:33:22,481 --> 01:33:25,398
And, Tolstoy.
I hate Russians.

1412
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,940
From "Anna Karenina" I read
the first page and the last.

1413
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:33,815
"Suddenly, I noticed a curious book.

1414
01:33:34,606 --> 01:33:38,440
I take it. Joan smiles.
"Children of the Storm".

1415
01:33:38,481 --> 01:33:41,106
Yes, it is written by Germain,
twenty years ago.

1416
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,106
He did not tell you?

1417
01:33:42,148 --> 01:33:44,606
- No.
And what is it about?

1418
01:33:44,648 --> 01:33:48,940
Banal love story.
Nothing special.

1419
01:33:48,981 --> 01:33:52,106
And not much compared
to his favorite authors.

1420
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:53,273
Too bad.

1421
01:33:53,315 --> 01:33:56,190
Sobriety is one of the
rare virtues of Germain.

1422
01:33:58,731 --> 01:34:02,565
You're similar,
but you have talent.

1423
01:34:03,398 --> 01:34:06,856
She's not like Esther,
but no less desirable.

1424
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:12,106
Take it.

1425
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,940
"She invites me to dinner.

1426
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:18,481
We're talk about the gallery,
mathematics, our friendship with Germain,

1427
01:34:18,523 --> 01:34:20,148
about her favorite books...

1428
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:21,898
And then all of a sudden... "

1429
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:24,690
Esther will never leave Rapha.

1430
01:34:24,773 --> 01:34:30,190
They're having difficult times,
but there is a strong connection.

1431
01:34:30,273 --> 01:34:35,148
Yes. They love each other and
are expecting a second child.

1432
01:34:36,523 --> 01:34:37,856
I didn't know.

1433
01:34:38,481 --> 01:34:41,773
Why don't you and Germaine have kids?

1434
01:34:44,898 --> 01:34:48,606
Somehow there was no
time to think about it.

1435
01:34:48,773 --> 01:34:50,023
I have my work...

1436
01:34:50,065 --> 01:34:51,856
He has his books

1437
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:56,856
By the way,
I thought maybe,he reaches out to you,

1438
01:34:56,898 --> 01:35:00,356
because he wants to be a father,
have a son?

1439
01:35:01,231 --> 01:35:03,190
Yes, he wanted a son.

1440
01:35:03,606 --> 01:35:05,148
He said that?

1441
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:11,440
He said that you could not have children,
because you are infertile.

1442
01:35:16,106 --> 01:35:18,690
- He said that?
Yes.

1443
01:35:28,106 --> 01:35:30,773
Yes?
Who?

1444
01:35:32,731 --> 01:35:33,856
No.

1445
01:35:33,898 --> 01:35:35,231
Well...

1446
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,815
Goodbye.

1447
01:35:45,315 --> 01:35:48,065
Germain has just been
fired from the school.

1448
01:35:48,106 --> 01:35:49,606
Why?

1449
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:53,356
Rapha told all about the math test.

1450
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:03,231
"Ever since I met Monsieur Germain,

1451
01:36:03,315 --> 01:36:07,106
I wanted to see how he lives,
what his house is like,

1452
01:36:07,231 --> 01:36:11,815
who's his wife, what she was doing,
if they have children,

1453
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,231
Do they still love each other?

1454
01:36:16,023 --> 01:36:17,440
Jeanne...

1455
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:19,356
Jeanne...

1456
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:23,731
The wife of Monsieur Germain
lies in front of me on the couch.

1457
01:36:23,773 --> 01:36:27,023
She sleeps.
And I listen to her breathing.

1458
01:36:29,106 --> 01:36:33,773
Her skirt is riding up. I can see
her skin is the color of alabaster.

1459
01:36:33,856 --> 01:36:37,481
She has beautiful legs.
Like Esther.

1460
01:36:38,898 --> 01:36:40,731
What am I doing here?

1461
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:43,065
While my teacher's wife
is sleeping next to me,

1462
01:36:43,106 --> 01:36:46,231
arousing the desire of the
student from the last row...

1463
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:50,148
I'm looking for the finale.
My finale.

1464
01:36:50,731 --> 01:36:54,398
Maybe I'll find it here.
In his house. "

1465
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:03,356
- What are you doing?
- Gathering my stuff.

1466
01:37:03,606 --> 01:37:07,773
- You're leaving? Yes.
The Gallery is finisher, and we are too.

1467
01:37:07,815 --> 01:37:10,815
- Where are you going?
I don't know. To mom.

1468
01:37:11,731 --> 01:37:14,981
Are you crazy? Today?
When I got fired?

1469
01:37:15,023 --> 01:37:18,356
Germain, I'm almost Esther,
but you are not Rapha,

1470
01:37:18,398 --> 01:37:20,773
and Claude will not be your son!

1471
01:37:21,898 --> 01:37:23,773
What are you talking about?

1472
01:37:33,023 --> 01:37:35,065
You slept with him?

1473
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:36,815
To be continued.

1474
01:37:36,856 --> 01:37:39,481
You slept with him?
Look at me, bitch!

1475
01:37:39,523 --> 01:37:41,231
Germain, you're crazy!

1476
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:43,315
He fucked you!

1477
01:37:57,273 --> 01:38:01,773
"Journey to the End of the Night. "
Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line

1478
01:38:35,315 --> 01:38:36,690
Hello, Claude.

1479
01:38:36,773 --> 01:38:39,190
Hello.
How are you?

1480
01:38:42,106 --> 01:38:43,773
Better.

1481
01:38:45,023 --> 01:38:48,065
Can I sit down?
- Of course.

1482
01:38:56,315 --> 01:38:58,898
Well, found your ending?

1483
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:03,398
No, I stopped writing.
I brought your book.

1484
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,023
Your wife gave it to me.

1485
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,648
Throw it away.
It's rubbish.

1486
01:39:10,023 --> 01:39:12,898
But I liked it.
About love.

1487
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:15,065
Then keep it.

1488
01:39:25,606 --> 01:39:29,315
You can see so many windows
and people from here!

1489
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:33,273
Yes, very many.

1490
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:40,315
As I was sitting in the park near Rapha,
I was like a spectator in the front row.

1491
01:39:40,398 --> 01:39:42,440
Sat and thought.

1492
01:39:43,356 --> 01:39:46,023
How do people live in these houses?

1493
01:39:49,648 --> 01:39:51,565
Here's an example...

1494
01:39:51,606 --> 01:39:54,648
These two women.
What do they do?

1495
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:57,190
You do not know them?

1496
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,148
No.

1497
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,023
They seem to be fighting.

1498
01:40:06,565 --> 01:40:11,148
Perhaps sisters.
Having a fight about the inheritance.

1499
01:40:11,981 --> 01:40:13,856
Two lesbians disagree.

1500
01:40:13,898 --> 01:40:17,731
No, the two sisters arguing
about the family mansion.

1501
01:40:17,766 --> 01:40:20,606
One wants to sell,
and one is against it.

1502
01:40:20,856 --> 01:40:26,023
Two lesbians. Their love was over, when the
blonde had a crush on the rheumatologist.

1503
01:40:26,065 --> 01:40:29,148
Brunette says,
"I introduced you two!"

1504
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:32,315
Look at her hands.
"I introduced you!"

1505
01:40:32,398 --> 01:40:35,648
"Now I understand why you always
went to see him without me. "

1506
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:38,190
"By no means!
You can not sell this house. "

1507
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:42,356
"Father fought for it for so many years. "

1508
01:40:43,148 --> 01:40:46,106
Do you want them to be twins?

1509
01:40:49,106 --> 01:40:51,106
Not really.

1510
01:40:52,648 --> 01:40:55,023
First floor,
the door on the right.

1511
01:40:55,856 --> 01:41:01,148
Stop it, Claude. It is unlikely that
they need lessons in mathematics.

1512
01:41:02,648 --> 01:41:05,398
But there is something they need.

1513
01:41:06,356 --> 01:41:12,023
There is always a way to get inside,
a way to get into any home.

1514
01:41:13,356 --> 01:41:15,398
You'll help me?

1515
01:41:34,231 --> 01:41:40,065
Monsieur Germain lost everything.
Wife, work. But I was there.

1516
01:41:40,106 --> 01:41:43,731
And ready to tell him a new story.

1517
01:41:46,065 --> 01:41:48,273
To be continued.
