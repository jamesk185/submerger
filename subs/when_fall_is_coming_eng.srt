1
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:27,783
Having heard Of Jesus' presence...

2
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,700
she appeared with a jar of fragrant oil.

3
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,783
She knelt at Jesus' feet...

4
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,866
And weeping she poured her tears over his feet

5
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:45,741
which she then dried with her hair,covered with kisses...

6
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:49,075
And anointed with the fragrant oil.

7
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:52,158
Seeing this...

8
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:57,325
said the Pharisee who had invited Jesus
to himself:

9
00:01:57,491 --> 00:02:01,033
If this man is a prophet...

10
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:03,783
he would know who this woman is:

11
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,325
A sinner.

12
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:09,366
But Jesus answered:

13
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:15,033
When I entered your house, you did
not pour water poured over my feet.

14
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:19,658
But she has washed my feet
Washed with her tears.

15
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:23,158
And with her hair dried.

16
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:28,991
And therefore her countless sins were
forgiven her.

17
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:32,991
For she showed much love.

18
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:37,033
This woman was Mary Magdalene.

19
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,783
The Body of Christ.

20
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,700
Amen.

21
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:09,866
Hello, mom.
- Hi, honey. Everything okay?

22
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,408
Yes yes.

23
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:16,033
And what time will you be there?

24
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,949
Then we can have a nice lunch together.

25
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,866
Shall I pick you up from the station?

26
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,491
Okay. But are you coming with Laurent's car?

27
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:32,533
That's none of your business, Mom.

28
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,616
Excuse me.

29
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:36,616
Fine.

30
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,533
Well, until tomorrow then.

31
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,575
Love to both.

32
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,116
I'm waiting for you here.

33
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,491
It's going to be really good.
- Yes, I hope so.

34
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,741
Go ahead.
Give him a kiss from me.

35
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,741
Correctional institution.

36
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,283
Marie-Claude Perrin.

37
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,533
Thank you very much.
- Have a nice day, ma'am.

38
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,283
Michelle?

39
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,658
Thank you for bringing it.

40
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,450
When do you want to go there again?

41
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:02,741
In ten days or so?

42
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,408
Good.

43
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,325
Come in, the door is open.

44
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,700
Everything okay?
Cup of coffee?

45
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,991
If there is time.
- Yes.

46
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,325
They don't come for one.
And with all the traffic jams...

47
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:03,033
Does your daughter
now have her driver's
license? - Yes.

48
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:06,116
You are still the only one without.

49
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:10,700
I slept badly last night.
- Logically, it's a full moon.

50
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:13,033
Maybe that's it.

51
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,325
Thank you.
- That's good for the mushrooms.

52
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,325
Where are the mushrooms?

53
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:37,533
Come on, there were
many last year.

54
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,991
Look here.

55
00:09:57,158 --> 00:10:00,366
Check this out.
- Yes, a boletus.

56
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,325
Yes, a boletus.

57
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,366
And a beautiful one, too.

58
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,616
Marie-Claude, look at this.

59
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:16,866
Is this a good one or not?
- No, that's a fake cockscomb.

60
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,658
Wonderful.

61
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,158
I walk on a little bit,
I have to go cook.

62
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,283
I love to hear the stories.

63
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,575
Absolutely. Get your fill.

64
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:55,741
Hello.

65
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:28,575
Grandma.
- Bye, my darling. Sweetheart.

66
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,533
Everything okay?
- Yes.

67
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,533
Bye, honey.
- I'm not kissing. I have a snotty cold.

68
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,866
Good trip?
- No, getting out of Paris was a disaster.

69
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:42,491
Lucas, your bag.
- I cooked delicious food for you.

70
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:45,741
We already ate a sandwich.
- I'm hungry.

71
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,908
Very good, dear.
We'll make it a nice vacation.

72
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:03,158
Who is she talking to?
- Dad.

73
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,408
What next?

74
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:09,366
Arguing about the vacation because of me.
- Well, no.

75
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:13,200
Listen carefully.
It's not you, it's them.

76
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,450
Come. We are going to cook together.

77
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,908
I have delicious fresh mushrooms.

78
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:25,741
I don't like those. - Of
course you do. You're
just going to taste them.

79
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,616
With some butter and garlic...

80
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:31,241
it's delicious.
- I don't like garlic.

81
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:35,366
Valerie, would you put your phone
put your phone away for a moment?

82
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,033
Stop it, mom.
I have enough stress as it is.

83
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,200
Is it tasty, dear?

84
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,658
Can I have the mushrooms?

85
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:50,783
It smells delicious. Is there garlic in it?
- Yes.

86
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,075
You didn't?
- No, you've spoiled my appetite.

87
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,033
Sorry, I just quit smoking.
I am rather irritable.

88
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,325
Have you gained some weight?

89
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:05,200
In my opinion, no.

90
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:09,325
Watch out, at your age
you shouldn't let yourself go.

91
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,033
By the way, how is Marie-Claude doing?

92
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:15,450
Up and down, but pretty good.

93
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:19,200
Is that deranged son of hers
still in jail?

94
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:23,700
Stop it, Valérie.
Everyone deserves a second chance.

95
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:26,075
The jerk didn't.

96
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,700
That boy has never had it easy.

97
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:31,825
I do sometimes?

98
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:36,825
How can you stand up for him
after what he did?

99
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:40,866
What did he do?
- Nothing. Eat your plate.

100
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:44,200
Anyone have any quiche or mushrooms?
- No thanks.

101
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,408
I spoke to a notary friend of mine.

102
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:16,075
If you donate to me now,
it will save you taxes after you die.

103
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,033
Is grandma going to die?
- Well no, I'm in perfect health.

104
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:21,575
Put the house in my name.

105
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,866
You don't like this house, do you?

106
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:27,116
It's not about that,
it's about value.

107
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,533
For the future, for Lucas.

108
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,241
But I have already given you my flat in Paris
already gifted you.

109
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,366
So what?

110
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:42,241
Does anyone want cheese?
- No, thanks.

111
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:46,700
Then I'll get dessert.
- No, I've already eaten too much.

112
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,908
I do, grandma.

113
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,033
I'll get it.

114
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:54,075
Thank you, dear.

115
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:10,158
It's nice weather for a walk.
- Good idea, yes.

116
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:13,783
Move over.
- But I need to make two phone calls.

117
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,824
And I still have to work.
Is the Internet better yet?

118
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:21,158
Yes, the entire village now has fiber optics.

119
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,241
Hallelujah.

120
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:28,324
What are we going to do this week, Grandma?
- Whatever you want, dear.

121
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:32,741
Walking, reading, watching movies...

122
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:34,533
cake baking.

123
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,200
I promised mom: no tablet.
- Very good.

124
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:42,658
But with me you may occasionally be
disobedient.

125
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,700
That's our little secret.

126
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:48,700
Do you want to play games with me?
- If you teach me.

127
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,491
Grandma?
- Yes, dear.

128
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:55,700
Don't you ever get bored here?
- No.

129
00:17:55,866 --> 00:18:01,033
I like to be close to nature,
the river, the trees.

130
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:05,241
I enjoy the birds singing.
I don't miss Paris at all.

131
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:08,533
But you are all alone.
- Well, no.

132
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,658
I have my friend Marie-Claude.

133
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,158
This is a must-see view.
Isn't this beautiful?

134
00:18:19,158 --> 00:18:21,283
Where is her home?

135
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,158
There. See that?

136
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:27,408
Beyond those trees. Do you see it?
- Yes.

137
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,866
A small house.
- Yes, but still...

138
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,533
What about you?

139
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,033
Would you want to live here?

140
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,575
Yes, maybe.
But Mom would never want it.

141
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:45,783
Yes, your mother always
hated it.

142
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,741
We're going back.
- Okay.

143
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,408
What's going on?

144
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,158
I'm sorry, what happened?
- A woman became unwell inside.

145
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,991
You are?
- Her mother. This is her son.

146
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:34,075
Go soon.

147
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:42,200
Bernard, what is it? -
Your daughter called us.
She's unconscious now.

148
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:45,866
What does she have? -
We're going
to find out in the ER.

149
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,325
It looks like poisoning.

150
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,033
The mushrooms.
- Did she eat them?

151
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:54,075
At noon.
Freshly picked with Marie-Claude.

152
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,075
Did you eat them, too?
- No, I wasn't hungry.

153
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,533
And the boy?
- I don't like mushrooms.

154
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,033
Can we come with you?
- Just come to the hospital.

155
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,825
Marie-Claude?

156
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:16,366
Do you know more yet?
- No, we are still waiting.

157
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,241
The doctor.

158
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:22,908
And?

159
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:27,283
Everything was fine. We got there in time.
Her stomach was pumped out.

160
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,991
It will be fine.
- I am glad.

161
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:34,825
Terrible, I had prepared the food.
- Something like that can happen.

162
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:39,366
But you must make a statement
at the police station.

163
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,450
The police? - Better
right now than for them
to come to your home.

164
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:46,825
We have to report the poisoning.

165
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:48,866
Of course, yes.

166
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:54,491
The doctor said you have to rest.
- No, I'm going back to Paris.

167
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:57,616
Are you sure you can drive?

168
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:02,741
Sleep here tonight.
Don't leave until tomorrow.

169
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:05,325
Stop it, mom.
We're going home.

170
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,033
We?

171
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,991
Lucas should stay.

172
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:15,033
What about his sleepover?
- I don't trust you anymore.

173
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:18,450
It was an accident.
- I was almost dead.

174
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:22,325
We could have been dead, too.
- No, you didn't eat it.

175
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,116
And you know Lucas doesn't like it.
You poisoned me.

176
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:29,033
You are toxic.
- What?

177
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:34,200
Accident or not, you are dangerous.
I'm not leaving my son here.

178
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:37,658
I want to stay with grandma.
- We're going home.

179
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:41,283
What about my vacation?
- We'll see about that with your father.

180
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,783
Some sandwiches for the road.

181
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,283
We don't have any use for that.
- What do you mean?

182
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:56,700
Rather transfer 500 euros,
I'll make it by the end of the month.

183
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,658
Here, dear.
- Thank you, grandma.

184
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:06,491
And have a check-up.
That's wise at your age.

185
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:57,950
Police station.

186
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,450
Tell.

187
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:22,575
Valérie did not press charges.
- The idea.

188
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:25,325
Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.

189
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:29,616
Did they say anything about the past?

190
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,325
No, nothing.

191
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:39,200
I feel guilty.
I should have checked your mushrooms.

192
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,033
Valérie thinks
I really wanted to kill her.

193
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:47,283
She always blames you for everything.

194
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:52,283
Doesn't want me to see Lucas anymore,
I'm so sorry.

195
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,616
What are you doing here?

196
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:40,325
Where is your mommy?
- There.

197
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:42,408
Do you want to go to her?
- Yes.

198
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,408
Michelle?

199
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:56,741
I'm not waking you up, am I?
- No, I'll be right there.

200
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,950
I am so happy.

201
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:12,450
If he finds work and reintegrates quickly,
he may receive punitive damages.

202
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,283
Very nice.
- Yes.

203
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,200
But jobs here are not
for the taking.

204
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:25,033
The important thing is that he gets out
and stays straight.

205
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:53,658
This is Valérie's voicemail...

206
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,866
Boy...

207
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:36,033
Happy to see me?
- Overjoyed.

208
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,700
It's not hard, you know.
Bye, gentlemen.

209
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:45,825
Goodbye.

210
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:48,491
I am lucky with this beautiful weather.

211
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:50,866
Are you okay?
- Yeah. And you?

212
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,533
Michelle is waiting for us.
- Shit, Michelle.

213
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,283
Always a real lady.
- Bye, boy.

214
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,616
Good to see you.
- Sweet that you came along.

215
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:04,616
Right? Come with me.

216
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,033
Need help?
- It's not hard.

217
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:11,158
Get out of here fast.

218
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:14,241
Before they change their minds.
- Imagine.

219
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,450
Where do you want to eat?

220
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:26,866
Doesn't matter.
The food there was incredibly gross.

221
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:31,491
How about La Beursaudière?
- Delicious, but not cheap.

222
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:35,366
My treat.
- That's sweet.

223
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:38,450
As long as they are not mushrooms.

224
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:45,033
Shit, how delicious.

225
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:49,075
To freedom, dear one.

226
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,616
Thank you, momma. Michelle...

227
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:55,241
To our health.

228
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:59,200
And no more silly things.

229
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,241
Finito.

230
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,200
Does anyone want dessert?
- Sure.

231
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:08,366
Can we have the dessert menu?
- What plans do you have?

232
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:12,158
I can work in a warehouse in Auxerre.

233
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,325
But Auxerre...

234
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,450
You can rent there.
- Yes, I can.

235
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:20,158
But what would you like to do?

236
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:25,158
I'd rather stay around here
And start a cafe.

237
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,908
That would...

238
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:29,991
It takes money to do that.
- I know.

239
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:34,033
Have you made a choice?
- Not yet.

240
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:37,075
Shit, profiteroles.
Ma? Michelle?

241
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,450
Yes, good idea.

242
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,575
Michelle?
- Just coffee.

243
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,283
One coffee, two profiteroles.
- Coming up.

244
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,450
You could work for me.

245
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,408
How so?

246
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:57,783
The garden is big. And I've been neglecting
the vegetable garden lately.

247
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,116
Wood needs to be chopped,
cleaned up.

248
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:04,158
Yes, why not? I am all for it.

249
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:09,283
Fifteen euros an hour, black?
- Great.

250
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:14,325
Thank you, Michelle.

251
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,325
See...

252
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,533
I'd like you to chop enough wood
for the whole winter.

253
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,158
Here...

254
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:36,491
lie all the tools you need.

255
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:39,658
And here is the vegetable garden.
There's a lot to do there.

256
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:42,158
I didn't have the oomph.

257
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:46,366
So you go first...

258
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:50,825
Remove all the weeds
between the plants.

259
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:53,033
And after that...

260
00:30:55,741 --> 00:31:00,616
you pick the pumpkins
and put them in the shed there.

261
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:03,450
After that, you throw them over.

262
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,700
All done.
- Great.

263
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:44,575
Shall I pay you right away?
- Please, I'll see my buddies tonight.

264
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,866
How many hours is it?

265
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,991
I started by two o'clock,
so about three and a half hours.

266
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:55,866
Okay, then I'll make it four hours.

267
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:01,700
Look, please.

268
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,450
Top. Same thing tomorrow?

269
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,533
Morning.
- Okay.

270
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,158
Very good.

271
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,616
Bye, ma'am.

272
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:09,491
Has the code changed?
- Yes.

273
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:12,533
Can you let me in?
- Where should you be?

274
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,158
At my daughter's house, on the sixth floor.
I used to live there myself.

275
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:19,825
Can't you call her?
- I want to surprise her.

276
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:23,741
Thank you.

277
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:53,366
Hello.

278
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:57,325
What are you doing here?

279
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:02,366
Since you didn't answer, I just came here
here. May I come in?

280
00:36:13,866 --> 00:36:19,283
What did you say to her?
- That I only have a few years left.

281
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,866
That I wanted to make up with her
And I wanted to see my grandson.

282
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:27,616
Is he at home?
- No, he is at school.

283
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:32,825
And will he be allowed to come
come to stay?

284
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,158
No.

285
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:38,825
She was talking about a year
to his father in Dubai.

286
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:42,325
What does Laurent think?
- He keeps out of it.

287
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,450
Their separation is painful enough.

288
00:36:45,616 --> 00:36:50,450
Consult a lawyer. A grandmother
has the right to see her grandchildren.

289
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:53,950
But with those mushrooms
I forfeited that.

290
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,700
Unbelievable. I gave her
my flat in Paris...

291
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:06,408
I send her money, I have consulted a notary about the house.

292
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:10,241
No thank you, nothing.

293
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:15,450
It's about my money to her,
and nothing else.

294
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:21,033
After all that slaving away for our children
we get stinkers.

295
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:25,283
You're not allowed to say that.
- Sorry, but that pisses me off.

296
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:30,450
Yes?

297
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,866
Were you here? Hello, Vincent.

298
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:37,533
I'm going out with my buddies.
- What buddies?

299
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,325
Will I see you tomorrow, Michelle?
- Yes, see you tomorrow.

300
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:50,366
I hate to say it.
But with our children...

301
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,908
we did nothing.

302
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:56,533
Cheers.
- To your health, darling.

303
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,158
Here.
- Michelle.

304
00:38:57,283 --> 00:39:00,408
Do you want to throw this away?
I don't need it anymore.

305
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,616
What is it? No, I can't.

306
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:06,533
Why not?
- Because.

307
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,908
You'll probably see your grandson again.
- No.

308
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:13,825
Too painful. I'd rather throw it away.
- But Michelle...

309
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:15,783
Need to hear.

310
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,408
Do whatever you want with it.
But I want it out of here. OK?

311
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:11,866
An antidepressant can help.
But it is more important that you stay busy.

312
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:14,991
Find an activity you enjoy.

313
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:16,991
I don't feel like doing anything.

314
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:21,491
The congregation is looking for volunteers.
You can lend a hand.

315
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:24,533
Or at church, at catechism class.

316
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,366
Catechism lesson?
Is that a joke?

317
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:29,491
Sorry.

318
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,575
Anyway...

319
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:36,283
Ever since I stopped seeing my grandson,
I have trouble with children.

320
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:44,325
I am afraid that I am going senile.

321
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:46,658
Why do you think that?

322
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:49,033
Are you forgetful?

323
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:52,991
I don't know.

324
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,075
It has been since...

325
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,658
that mushroom story
with my daughter.

326
00:40:57,825 --> 00:41:01,991
That could have happened to anyone.
You know that.

327
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:04,866
Yes, but it had never
happened to me before.

328
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,700
Next time pay better attention.

329
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,783
No, I will never pick mushrooms again.

330
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:16,991
You should not feel guilty
or punish yourself, Mrs. Giraud.

331
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:19,408
It was not intentional.

332
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:22,533
Right?

333
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,408
I don't remember.

334
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,700
Marie-Claude?
- Michelle?

335
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:04,616
Did anything happen?
- No.

336
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:09,408
Vincent is not here yet.
- He left early. I didn't hear him.

337
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:12,158
He forgot his phone again.

338
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:15,116
We would clean up the garage.

339
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,450
Today?
- Yes.

340
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:21,491
Maybe he went to Auxerre first?

341
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:24,325
Possibly.

342
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:26,616
Sorry, I must have forgotten.

343
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:28,533
Doesn't matter.
- Thank you. Love.

344
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,450
Love back.

345
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:13,741
Hello. You're looking for?

346
00:44:13,908 --> 00:44:16,366
Don't you recognize me?
- No.

347
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:20,158
Marie-Claude's son.

348
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:25,616
Weren't you...
- No, I'm free again.

349
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:30,533
A long time ago.
- Yeah, crazy, right?

350
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,950
May I come in?

351
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:56,116
Yeah, awful, no? I should get rid of
my mother's furniture soon.

352
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:58,283
Sugar?
- No.

353
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:02,408
Okay...

354
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,075
What have you come to do in Paris?

355
00:45:06,825 --> 00:45:09,116
Looking you up.

356
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:11,450
Me?
- Yes.

357
00:45:11,616 --> 00:45:14,533
To... talk about Michelle.

358
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:18,700
What is this?
Did she send you?

359
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:23,866
No, not that, but... Just...

360
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:27,825
Your mother is sad.
You are hurting her.

361
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:31,658
Am I hurting her?
Are you making fun of me?

362
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:36,158
You keep her grandson away from her.
You can't do that.

363
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:39,991
Without her, you wouldn't have been here.
- What are you talking about?

364
00:45:40,158 --> 00:45:43,533
Why are you meddling with this?
Why are you lecturing me?

365
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,575
Doesn't matter.

366
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:50,158
Your mother is a good person.
You shouldn't treat her that way.

367
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:54,825
I can't follow you. What exactly is
your relationship with my mother?

368
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:56,908
Tell us.

369
00:45:57,075 --> 00:45:59,533
We know about her shitty past.

370
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,783
And from your mother.
They worked together.

371
00:46:03,783 --> 00:46:06,658
Didn't you have a problem with their stuff?

372
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,700
I do.

373
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,616
Don't you see how they damaged us?

374
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:18,158
You just got out of the slammer.

375
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:22,616
And I'm so unhappy
I could jump out the window.

376
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,491
She disgusts me.

377
00:46:28,658 --> 00:46:30,908
To throw up.

378
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:34,533
- You shouldn't talk
about your mother
that way. - No?

379
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,533
How should I
talk about my dear little mistress?

380
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,950
Like about a saint?

381
00:46:46,241 --> 00:46:48,825
I need a fag.

382
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:21,491
Hello. Yes?

383
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:26,491
Bye, Laurent.

384
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,991
What?

385
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,991
No way...

386
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:44,908
How did that happen?

387
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,283
And Lucas?

388
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,241
Yes.

389
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:54,991
Yes, yes...

390
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:57,158
Well, yes...

391
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:01,700
Tomorrow.

392
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:04,616
Call... Are you calling me?

393
00:48:04,783 --> 00:48:07,075
Good.

394
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,158
I'm waiting.

395
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:02,408
You're home.

396
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:07,200
Had a moment's warning.
Michelle was worried.

397
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:13,325
Where have you been?

398
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:19,366
Vincent, what is it?

399
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,241
Nothing.

400
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:26,075
What did you do?

401
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,700
Nothing.

402
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:31,450
Where were you?
- Paris.

403
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:34,283
Paris? What did you have to do there?

404
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:39,408
I went to see Michelle's daughter.
- Valérie? Why?

405
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:44,658
To talk to her, to tell her mother's
life is so hard.

406
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:47,033
What are you meddling with?

407
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:50,533
Michelle was sad.
I wanted to help.

408
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,616
I tried to talk to her.
And then...

409
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:59,158
Then what?

410
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:01,366
And then...

411
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:03,491
she fell.

412
00:50:03,658 --> 00:50:06,741
Fell?
- Off the balcony, the stupid bitch.

413
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:10,366
You can't be serious.

414
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:12,866
It was an accident.

415
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:17,450
We stood on the balcony
and we were getting words and...

416
00:50:17,616 --> 00:50:20,908
Did you push her?
- No, it was an accident.

417
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:23,783
My best friend's daughter.

418
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,283
No ma, don't cry, dammit.

419
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:32,991
Does Michelle know?
- I think so, she calls all
the time. Don't cry.

420
00:50:33,158 --> 00:50:35,408
It is not true.

421
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:38,241
It is not true.

422
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:41,616
Are you going to tell her?

423
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:45,491
Are you recording?

424
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:52,991
Listen, Ma. I don't want
to go back to jail. I really don't.

425
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:56,950
Ma...

426
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:04,950
Hello, Michelle?

427
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,033
Inspector...
- Let her in.

428
00:51:27,158 --> 00:51:29,158
Sorry, sir.

429
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:32,450
Valérie was in divorce.

430
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:37,783
She was having problems at work.
Money worries.

431
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,533
And.

432
00:51:42,158 --> 00:51:43,866
Yes?

433
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:49,033
I was not the mother
that she had wanted.

434
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:52,200
This is more common.

435
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:54,408
Yes, but...

436
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:01,325
I used to be a prostitute.

437
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:06,033
My daughter has never
been able to accept that.

438
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,158
I see.

439
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:15,575
Could it have been suicide?

440
00:52:16,575 --> 00:52:19,158
I don't know.

441
00:52:19,325 --> 00:52:21,450
It could.

442
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:25,241
She was very unstable.

443
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:33,283
Has she sent you any messages recently?
- No.

444
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:39,158
Were there people
who were angry with her?

445
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:44,741
Not that I know of.

446
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:46,450
Good.

447
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:50,908
Perhaps autopsy is necessary.

448
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:54,325
Before we decide to do so...

449
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:59,033
I want to take you to her apartment
to see if you see anything remarkable.

450
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:17,908
How much longer?
- Three months.

451
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:20,991
Boy or girl?

452
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:23,075
I don't need to know that.

453
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,658
What about the father?
- There is no father.

454
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:29,283
Sorry.
- Never mind.

455
00:53:34,616 --> 00:53:36,533
Bye, ma'am.

456
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:42,491
And?

457
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:46,033
No traces of breaking
Or of a struggle.

458
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:51,700
A full cup of coffee.
- With only the victim's fingerprints.

459
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,033
Is it there?

460
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:06,533
Up here she had cigarettes lying around.
You need the steps for that.

461
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,825
I think she went to get cigarettes
and slipped.

462
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:15,700
Where was her body?
- Right below.

463
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,741
Are you okay?

464
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:26,033
To me, it's clear.
She fell from this.

465
00:54:27,616 --> 00:54:31,283
I ask permission for burial.
- No autopsy?

466
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:33,450
Not needed.
- OK.

467
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,616
I just...

468
00:54:38,783 --> 00:54:41,450
one last question.

469
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,783
Do you still have contact
with the prostitution world?

470
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,325
No, that's over. I'm retired.

471
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:52,491
Since when?
- Since...

472
00:54:54,075 --> 00:54:56,741
Before the birth of my grandson.

473
00:54:57,825 --> 00:55:01,658
Checked her background?
- She had posh clients.

474
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:05,533
Has had problems on several occasions
with pimps.

475
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,283
She worked for quite a long time.

476
00:55:44,283 --> 00:55:46,366
Hello.

477
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,866
Laurent...

478
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:02,450
Come.

479
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:06,575
Did you come here this morning?

480
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:08,283
Yes.

481
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:13,033
You know, Michelle...

482
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:16,116
Valérie and I loved each other.

483
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:18,533
But in a wrong way.

484
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:21,908
I feel guilty.

485
00:56:22,075 --> 00:56:24,700
You can't help it.

486
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,908
We should have stayed together.
- It wouldn't have made any difference.

487
00:56:32,616 --> 00:56:35,283
We were still arguing that morning.

488
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,283
About what?

489
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:40,825
About Lucas, as always.

490
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:45,158
Sorry, you will have to go outside.

491
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:48,533
The apartment must now remain sealed.

492
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:08,408
See.

493
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:11,991
A huge desert. Pools...

494
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:17,283
skyscrapers. And look here...

495
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,408
There's my office.
Beautiful, isn't it?

496
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:22,783
Yes.

497
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,325
You will like it there.

498
00:57:25,491 --> 00:57:28,200
Always nice, warm weather.

499
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:34,783
There is even a French school
You can make friends there.

500
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,616
No.

501
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:39,533
No what?

502
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,408
I don't want to go there.

503
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:45,950
You can't stay here by yourself, dear.

504
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:36,866
Let's go. Up.

505
00:58:37,866 --> 00:58:41,158
Otherwise, you'll be late for school.

506
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,158
Come on, kid. You can do it.

507
00:58:50,658 --> 00:58:52,658
Darling.

508
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:55,200
Breakfast is ready.

509
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:20,283
What are you thinking about?

510
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,491
Nothing.

511
00:59:23,491 --> 00:59:26,491
Do they still call you Parisian at school?

512
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:28,033
Sometimes.

513
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:31,075
Don't get caught off guard.

514
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:44,783
OK.

515
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:49,283
I'll pick you up.
- I'll take the bus. Just like the others.

516
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,075
Well then.

517
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,866
See you later. Take good care.

518
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:58,033
Bye, ma'am.

519
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:30,033
Lucas is doing well, you know.

520
01:00:30,158 --> 01:00:34,366
In the beginning it was difficult.
But now it's going well, I think.

521
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,783
Mom, you killed me.

522
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:45,491
How can you say such a thing?

523
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:48,408
Nobody killed you.

524
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:51,533
According to police, it was an accident.

525
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,366
An accident?

526
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:56,075
Yes.

527
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,575
Or suicide, if you will.

528
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,200
You would rather.

529
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,825
You were so unhappy. Because of
your divorce and all your problems.

530
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,741
You now have what you wanted.

531
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:16,700
No.

532
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:19,158
Yep.

533
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:21,325
My son.

534
01:01:50,075 --> 01:01:53,783
How is Lucas doing?
- He's starting to find his feet.

535
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,158
Doesn't he find it tough?

536
01:01:56,325 --> 01:01:58,075
You got me.

537
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,533
You are holding your own.

538
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:05,616
When I think of Valérie,
I hear her reproaches, her angry temper.

539
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:10,950
Somehow I am relieved that she is no
longer there. And I don't even feel guilty.

540
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,616
Can I have a cigarette?

541
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:34,366
What about your son?
- I'm afraid he'll do stupid things again.

542
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:38,325
Well, he's serious now.
He's working on his project.

543
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,908
And how did he
get that money for his café?

544
01:02:43,408 --> 01:02:45,741
Something you are not telling me?

545
01:02:47,616 --> 01:02:50,533
Didn't he say anything?
- No. Then what?

546
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:55,033
I gave him that money.

547
01:02:56,241 --> 01:03:00,616
He pays it back later.
I wanted to get him going.

548
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:03,533
Why did you do that?

549
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,325
I like your son.
He helped me too.

550
01:03:11,991 --> 01:03:13,450
What is it?

551
01:03:13,616 --> 01:03:17,325
Hopefully, he
doesn't end up in jail again because of you.

552
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:36,075
Marie-Claude.

553
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:49,325
How is she doing? -
They are keeping her
overnight for observation.

554
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:53,325
Did she break something?
- Not that, but...

555
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:57,783
They are doing some research.
It doesn't look good.

556
01:04:07,575 --> 01:04:11,741
Why hadn't you said anything about the money?
- Why should I?

557
01:04:11,908 --> 01:04:14,783
As a result, she was upset.
- She was?

558
01:04:17,783 --> 01:04:21,366
Lucas is waiting for me.
- How is he?

559
01:04:21,533 --> 01:04:24,575
Good. How come?
- Well, his mother is dead.

560
01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:28,991
Will you keep me informed?

561
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:33,533
Lucas.

562
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:48,200
Open up.
Why are you sitting there doing nothing?

563
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:49,825
Nothing.

564
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:52,741
Come and eat.

565
01:04:58,075 --> 01:05:01,241
You are not very talkative tonight.

566
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:07,366
You know...

567
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:11,533
I did see the bruise on your forehead though.

568
01:05:15,783 --> 01:05:19,450
What happened? Did you fight?

569
01:05:20,575 --> 01:05:23,658
Did they beat you?
- I'm not hungry anymore.

570
01:05:23,825 --> 01:05:26,033
I'll go to my room.

571
01:05:39,825 --> 01:05:41,783
What are you watching?

572
01:05:42,783 --> 01:05:44,950
Photos from the past.

573
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:49,408
They say you're a whore at school

574
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:52,991
Who says so?

575
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,158
The big boys.

576
01:05:57,575 --> 01:06:00,033
Well...

577
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:02,825
I used to be.

578
01:06:02,991 --> 01:06:06,033
In Paris, I did that for a few years.

579
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:11,908
You didn't have to do that.
- Sometimes you have to.

580
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:14,950
Because someone is forcing you.

581
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:20,991
I find you disgusting.

582
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:24,825
I get that.

583
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:29,325
But... it was a way
to keep our heads above water.

584
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:33,158
So that your mother was
to lack nothing.

585
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:36,616
I know it's no ordinary work...

586
01:06:36,783 --> 01:06:38,908
it was my job.

587
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,616
Is that why Mommy was mad at you?

588
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:44,116
Yes.

589
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,783
She was ashamed of me.

590
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,741
Something like that
is difficult for children.

591
01:06:51,783 --> 01:06:54,075
But that is now a thing of the past.

592
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:58,825
It's all about us now.

593
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:01,241
Especially about you.

594
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:03,783
And I will help you.

595
01:07:04,866 --> 01:07:09,158
I will make sure that you are well,
that you're happy.

596
01:07:15,283 --> 01:07:17,283
You look like mom.

597
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,991
Michelle, how cool that you came.

598
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:37,075
Speaks for itself.

599
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,241
Ma's in.
- Was she allowed out of the hospital?

600
01:07:40,408 --> 01:07:45,408
I'm going to see her soon.
- How are you? Sit down.

601
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:47,491
Hello.

602
01:07:47,658 --> 01:07:49,575
Marie-Claude.

603
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:53,991
No but, you look cute.

604
01:07:54,158 --> 01:07:56,158
I made myself up.

605
01:07:57,158 --> 01:07:59,575
Good thing, right?

606
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:02,325
He fixed it up nicely.

607
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:05,075
It's only going to cause misery.

608
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:10,283
Why so morbid?
Have faith in your son.

609
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,450
It's going to work.

610
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,908
I have to go back tomorrow.

611
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:18,158
More research?

612
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:22,490
Are you worried?
- No, fatalistic.

613
01:08:27,783 --> 01:08:30,490
Is everything going well here?

614
01:08:35,908 --> 01:08:37,740
Dancing?

615
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,408
Let's celebrate love
while we still can

616
01:08:50,575 --> 01:08:54,325
and not wait
until death knocks at the door

617
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:58,783
let's celebrate love
while we still can

618
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:03,783
when I feel like dancing
I dance now

619
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,865
it is true

620
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:19,783
we cannot change the world

621
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,865
I know

622
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,865
but believing that for a moment
does you good

623
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:29,158
let's celebrate love
while we still can.

624
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:41,533
Your grandmother can dance well.

625
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:47,240
- How long have you known grandma?
- For a very long time. From Paris.

626
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:50,575
Did you do the same thing she did?

627
01:09:53,075 --> 01:09:55,865
Does the cap come off?
- Don't.

628
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,450
Sorry to hear.

629
01:09:57,616 --> 01:10:01,866
Look at that old whore.
That blonde slut.

630
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:05,283
What did you say?

631
01:10:12,616 --> 01:10:16,200
Vincent, don't.
Let's have some fun.

632
01:10:18,283 --> 01:10:22,283
He never changes either.
- Bring on the music.

633
01:10:53,658 --> 01:10:56,700
Good morning, Vincent.
- Ha, Michelle.

634
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:58,991
Everything okay?

635
01:11:00,033 --> 01:11:02,200
A glass of white.

636
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:05,991
Did you close late?
- Sure.

637
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:09,866
But it won't be a party every night.

638
01:11:12,241 --> 01:11:15,616
Glad Marie-Claude could be there.
- Certainly.

639
01:11:15,783 --> 01:11:18,283
But she's not doing well.

640
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,408
Pros.

641
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,366
She shouldn't be so gloomy.

642
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:26,950
Something is bothering her.
But she doesn't tell me anything.

643
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:33,158
Vincent... I would like to...

644
01:11:33,283 --> 01:11:35,283
What?

645
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:38,158
That you do something for me one more time.

646
01:11:56,991 --> 01:11:59,158
- What are you doing here?

647
01:11:59,283 --> 01:12:03,616
I came to pick you up. Michelle says you're being bullied. Is that true?

648
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:07,283
Those guys over there?
- No.

649
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:11,158
By whom, then?

650
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:15,908
By those big guys over there.
- Those over there? Okay.

651
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:19,158
Wait for me at the bus stop.
I'll be right there.

652
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,116
What did you say?
- That I have been in prison.

653
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:34,658
Really?

654
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:39,616
Not that I'm proud of that, mind you.
But they were impressed.

655
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,283
What did you show them?

656
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:53,616
Don't touch.

657
01:12:55,366 --> 01:12:57,033
Do you recognize it?

658
01:12:57,158 --> 01:12:59,908
Not so. Sucker.

659
01:13:06,575 --> 01:13:09,283
Why was Vincent in prison?

660
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:12,450
Sorry?
- Why was he in prison?

661
01:13:13,866 --> 01:13:17,075
He used to do stupid things.

662
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,366
Did he kill someone?

663
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:22,533
Well no. Why do you say that?

664
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:27,408
Because prisoners are killers.
- Not always. Fortunately not.

665
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:30,991
Comes with your plate.

666
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:33,575
Why doesn't he have a wife?

667
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:41,200
I have no idea. Since he lives
with his mother, it might be difficult.

668
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:44,450
Ask him.

669
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:47,491
Are you doing well in school?
- Yes.

670
01:13:47,658 --> 01:13:51,408
Do you have good grades?
- Yes, it's easier than in Paris.

671
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:54,408
But keep doing your best, though.

672
01:13:54,575 --> 01:13:57,575
Don't worry, Laurent.

673
01:13:57,741 --> 01:14:01,075
Lucas works hard and is very serious.

674
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,450
Okay. So you like the countryside?
- Yes.

675
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:11,741
Will you come live with me next year?
- We'll see.

676
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:18,033
I would love that.

677
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:21,450
Don't worry.
He'll come all right.

678
01:14:22,783 --> 01:14:24,825
Thank you, Michelle.

679
01:14:44,783 --> 01:14:46,658
Vincent?

680
01:14:49,325 --> 01:14:50,825
Are you okay?

681
01:14:59,533 --> 01:15:01,825
Grandma's cake.

682
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:05,491
Don't laugh.
I made your favorite cake.

683
01:15:06,491 --> 01:15:09,450
That's sweet.
But I have less and less of an appetite.

684
01:15:09,616 --> 01:15:13,158
Do your best.
You should not despair.

685
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:17,408
It's too late, Michelle.
- No, there is always hope.

686
01:15:18,616 --> 01:15:20,991
The cancer has spread.

687
01:15:23,908 --> 01:15:28,866
Did they say that?
- I wanted them to tell the truth.

688
01:15:29,033 --> 01:15:32,408
But surely there is a treatment.

689
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:35,200
Too burdensome and pointless.

690
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:40,616
I need to tell you something
before I go.

691
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:47,575
Was I a bad mother?

692
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:52,616
Did Vincent go
fallen off the tracks?

693
01:15:52,783 --> 01:15:54,283
No.

694
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:56,575
We did our best.

695
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:59,658
And your son is doing well now.

696
01:16:00,825 --> 01:16:03,658
He is serious about his café.

697
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,616
Promise to keep watching him.

698
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,783
I promise.

699
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:15,283
You know...

700
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,033
On the day of Valérie's death...

701
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:23,241
Vincent was not in Auxerre.

702
01:16:25,408 --> 01:16:27,658
He was in Paris at the time.

703
01:16:36,741 --> 01:16:41,200
Vincent's good intentions
always backfire.

704
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:51,325
The important thing is
that he means well.

705
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:14,325
'That I quenched my thirst...'
Yes.

706
01:17:14,491 --> 01:17:20,283
'That I quenched my thirst,
A good twenty paces downstream from thee.

707
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:23,450
So that I would not muddy your waters.

708
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:29,116
'You do, ' Grimbeard exclaimed.
And last year you spoke ill of me.'

709
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:33,533
'Then I wasn't born yet, the lamb said.'
- 'Then it was your brother.'

710
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,700
'I don't have a brother.'

711
01:17:40,075 --> 01:17:42,075
Yes, Vincent?

712
01:17:45,616 --> 01:17:47,866
No way...

713
01:17:48,033 --> 01:17:49,825
When?

714
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:53,700
My goodness...

715
01:17:53,866 --> 01:17:56,158
Did she suffer?

716
01:17:56,325 --> 01:17:58,241
Yes, yes...

717
01:17:58,408 --> 01:17:59,991
Okay.

718
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:03,491
Much love.

719
01:18:04,825 --> 01:18:07,283
I'll stop by later.

720
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,200
Are you sad?

721
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:28,241
She was my best friend.
My sister.

722
01:19:23,616 --> 01:19:26,450
Who are they?
- Girlfriends.

723
01:19:52,866 --> 01:19:55,533
Where is Vincent?
- He was outside smoking.

724
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,241
Go get it soon.

725
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:08,908
Vincent?

726
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:27,283
They are waiting for you.
- I can't.

727
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:31,700
You know, when my mother passed away.

728
01:20:31,866 --> 01:20:34,616
I went to her funeral.

729
01:20:44,075 --> 01:20:47,450
You're bleeding.
- I bumped myself.

730
01:20:52,241 --> 01:20:53,783
Please.

731
01:21:07,616 --> 01:21:09,491
Hold on.

732
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,533
Shit, say.

733
01:21:17,866 --> 01:21:20,450
The life of Marie-Claude...

734
01:21:20,616 --> 01:21:23,658
has known light and shadow sides.

735
01:21:23,825 --> 01:21:26,533
But we don't judge her.

736
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,450
For God does not judge...

737
01:21:29,616 --> 01:21:32,741
While He knows everything about us.

738
01:21:32,908 --> 01:21:36,783
To Him, we are like an open book.

739
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:40,700
He has only one purpose:
to redeem us.

740
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:47,116
Let us remember in our prayers
To all our memories.

741
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:51,075
To our beloved Marie-Claude.

742
01:24:30,991 --> 01:24:33,325
See, I'm coming to see you.

743
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:41,450
I found your favorite plant.
Which was also on your balcony.

744
01:25:05,241 --> 01:25:07,741
I heard that you were here.

745
01:25:07,908 --> 01:25:11,408
Can I have a word with you?
- Yes.

746
01:25:11,575 --> 01:25:16,200
Shall we go to the café?
- No, that's not a good idea.

747
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,283
I would rather go to your house.

748
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,783
Fine.

749
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:31,700
So the baby is here?
- Yes.

750
01:25:31,866 --> 01:25:34,991
A girl.
- Great.

751
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:37,491
What's her name?
- Eve.

752
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,783
The first years with my daughter
were wonderful.

753
01:25:48,075 --> 01:25:50,408
We were very close.

754
01:25:51,658 --> 01:25:53,991
Only later did the bond deteriorate.

755
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:57,366
Did she have a father?

756
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,741
Of course.

757
01:26:00,908 --> 01:26:03,575
But he did not care about her.

758
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:06,991
He only gave us money, too late.

759
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:12,491
Money is not love
and is never enough.

760
01:26:12,658 --> 01:26:14,950
Sit down.

761
01:26:22,658 --> 01:26:26,033
I have doubts
about Valérie's cause of death.

762
01:26:27,533 --> 01:26:30,283
How so?

763
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:34,616
I'm not sure if it was
was an accident or suicide.

764
01:26:36,241 --> 01:26:38,866
I fear it was possibly murder.

765
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:43,658
Because of the mushrooms?
- No.

766
01:26:43,825 --> 01:26:46,575
I don't suspect you directly either.

767
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:50,450
Who is it?
- Your friend Marie-Claude's son.

768
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:53,741
Vincent?

769
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:58,241
Why him?
- We received anonymous letters.

770
01:26:58,408 --> 01:27:01,075
And you know his past.

771
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,866
He has been in prison.

772
01:27:04,866 --> 01:27:08,616
Do you remember where he was
on the day of Valérie's death?

773
01:27:32,741 --> 01:27:34,575
I know that, yes.

774
01:27:36,783 --> 01:27:39,075
Vincent was here.

775
01:27:40,075 --> 01:27:46,325
He was working in the garden
when my son-in-law Laurent called me...

776
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:50,366
with the news of Valérie.

777
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:54,408
Are you sure?

778
01:27:54,575 --> 01:27:56,533
Yes.

779
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:05,283
Would you like coffee?

780
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,408
No, thank you.

781
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,533
By the way.

782
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,408
Does his phone indicate
that he was in Paris?

783
01:28:14,575 --> 01:28:17,450
No, we polled it here.

784
01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:22,450
He could have left it here on purpose.
- Well, no.

785
01:28:22,616 --> 01:28:25,783
Young people never go out without a phone
on the road.

786
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:28,033
He is not that young.

787
01:28:29,783 --> 01:28:35,158
Surely you gave him money for his cafe,
after the death of your daughter?

788
01:28:35,325 --> 01:28:36,991
Yes.

789
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:41,450
A loan to get him started.
- Has he paid it back yet?

790
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,366
Not yet.

791
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:48,700
But I trust him.

792
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:50,825
Nice gift.

793
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:53,991
Vincent has not had it easy.

794
01:28:55,158 --> 01:28:58,158
He's a little...

795
01:28:58,325 --> 01:29:00,533
Like a son to me.

796
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:05,158
His mother and I were very close.

797
01:29:05,325 --> 01:29:08,325
She asked me to help him.

798
01:29:11,616 --> 01:29:13,450
Grandma?

799
01:29:15,866 --> 01:29:18,700
Are you all right, dear?
- Yeah.

800
01:29:18,866 --> 01:29:21,075
Did it go well in school?

801
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,283
This is my grandson, Lucas.

802
01:29:26,866 --> 01:29:30,366
He lives here.
His father lives abroad.

803
01:29:30,533 --> 01:29:33,075
This is Vincent, Marie-Claude's son.

804
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,241
Hello. I recognized you already.

805
01:29:36,408 --> 01:29:39,533
And you are?
- She is from the Paris police.

806
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,283
In reference to Valérie.

807
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:48,325
Do you mind
if I ask Lucas a few questions?

808
01:29:48,491 --> 01:29:50,366
No.

809
01:29:50,533 --> 01:29:52,366
Are you coming?

810
01:29:52,533 --> 01:29:54,616
Out for a while?
- Good.

811
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,200
To the swing?

812
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:08,575
Beautiful garden.

813
01:30:09,825 --> 01:30:13,366
Do you like it here?
- Yes, very much so.

814
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:16,866
Do you get along with grandma?
- Yes.

815
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:20,866
And do you see Vincent often?

816
01:30:21,033 --> 01:30:24,783
Yes, he picks me up from school
and we play soccer together.

817
01:30:26,325 --> 01:30:29,450
- Is he nice to you?
- Yes.

818
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:35,575
In the hall of the building where you lived,
there was a security camera.

819
01:30:36,575 --> 01:30:39,200
When I took another look
one more time...

820
01:30:39,366 --> 01:30:43,700
I found images of people
who came in before her accident.

821
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:47,950
You see residents going in.

822
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:53,283
And in one picture we see you.
See? That's you.

823
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:57,450
This is where you hold
the door open for a man.

824
01:30:59,825 --> 01:31:03,491
You can't see his face
Because of his hoodie.

825
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:06,783
Do you remember?

826
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,366
Did you know this man?

827
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:19,283
Could it be Vincent?

828
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:25,283
No, he wasn't.

829
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:27,950
Are you sure?

830
01:31:33,616 --> 01:31:35,158
Yes.

831
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:53,283
Vincent, are we going to play soccer?
- Let's go.

832
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:57,741
May we?
- Yes.

833
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,741
Did it go well?
- Yes.

834
01:32:08,908 --> 01:32:11,991
Did he cooperate well?
- Yes.

835
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:16,825
Since the death of his mother, he has been...
- I know.

836
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:22,450
I baked a cake for him.
Would you like a piece?

837
01:32:23,866 --> 01:32:25,533
Gladly.

838
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:31,075
Everything okay?
- And you? It's been a long time.

839
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:34,075
Come here.

840
01:33:35,325 --> 01:33:38,825
Shall I take your bag?
- No need.

841
01:33:38,991 --> 01:33:41,533
The car is right there.

842
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,241
Had a good trip?
- Yes.

843
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:51,575
How are things?
In Paris, the study and so on...

844
01:33:51,741 --> 01:33:53,533
Good.

845
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:56,783
Through a friend of Dad's
I found an attic room.

846
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:59,283
Nice.

847
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:02,158
What exactly are you studying?

848
01:34:02,283 --> 01:34:06,200
Art History.
- What can you do with that at all?

849
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:10,491
I don't know that yet.
- Of course you don't.

850
01:34:10,658 --> 01:34:12,616
Not yet.

851
01:34:12,783 --> 01:34:15,158
Do you have a girlfriend?

852
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,408
No.
- No?

853
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:28,741
And you still not married?
- Not that I know of.

854
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:47,241
Grandma.
- Dear Lucas.

855
01:34:47,408 --> 01:34:50,408
How nice to see you.
Come here.

856
01:34:53,366 --> 01:34:55,241
Quickly go inside. It's cold.

857
01:34:55,408 --> 01:34:58,200
Will you eat with us?
- Gladly.

858
01:34:58,366 --> 01:35:00,658
Close the gate behind you.

859
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:33,366
Shit, what a delicious quiche.

860
01:35:35,075 --> 01:35:37,741
Can I have some more?

861
01:35:37,908 --> 01:35:41,533
Sorry, canned mushrooms.
- Delicious.

862
01:35:43,658 --> 01:35:47,783
Do you like mushrooms these days?
- Always have.

863
01:35:50,575 --> 01:35:52,533
Is your café running well?
- Sure.

864
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:56,616
Especially by all the Parisians
who have settled here.

865
01:35:59,408 --> 01:36:01,575
Want to go to the cemetery?

866
01:36:06,408 --> 01:36:08,700
It doesn't have to be, you know.

867
01:36:08,866 --> 01:36:12,866
I was just there yesterday.
Your mother's grave is nice and clean.

868
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:15,158
I brought flowers.

869
01:36:18,241 --> 01:36:20,408
I don't know.

870
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:23,825
I don't like coming there either. So...

871
01:36:23,991 --> 01:36:26,908
I'd rather take a walk in the woods.

872
01:36:27,075 --> 01:36:29,366
Just like before?
- Yes.

873
01:36:30,366 --> 01:36:34,533
I baked a cake. A slice?
- Sure enough.

874
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,533
I'm going to get it.
- No, let me.

875
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,325
Thank you, dear.

876
01:36:39,491 --> 01:36:43,158
He is standing on the table.
Grab plates as well.

877
01:36:43,283 --> 01:36:45,950
That little one has grown up.
- Sure.

878
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,075
It's a beautiful boy.
- Yes.

879
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,533
He looks like his mother.

880
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:02,700
Would you hand me my bag?
It's on the chair.

881
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:11,533
The keys to the house.

882
01:37:12,658 --> 01:37:14,825
It's yours now.

883
01:37:16,658 --> 01:37:18,033
Thank you.

884
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:24,033
After I die, you may sell it.
That's what your mother wanted.

885
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:29,908
No.

886
01:37:31,616 --> 01:37:33,616
I want to keep it.

887
01:38:04,575 --> 01:38:07,241
Let me help you.

888
01:38:07,408 --> 01:38:12,325
Easy, guys.
I can still stand on my own two feet.

889
01:38:12,491 --> 01:38:14,491
That way.

890
01:38:15,533 --> 01:38:17,450
So...

891
01:38:30,533 --> 01:38:33,533
And the pinball machine?
- I sold that one.

892
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:37,533
Really. I needed money.

893
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:42,033
Too bad.
- You put a lot of hours behind it.

894
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:34,241
Mom...

895
01:39:47,325 --> 01:39:49,241
Where is grandma?

896
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:53,075
She was just walking behind us.

897
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:56,283
Michelle.

898
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,658
Grandma?
- Michelle?

899
01:40:02,991 --> 01:40:06,075
I walk to the car.You look here.

900
01:40:07,825 --> 01:40:09,991
Michelle.
- Grandma.

901
01:40:42,908 --> 01:40:44,616
Vincent...
